Hello there - and welcome to my little corner of the internet!\
I built this website as a space to jot down thoughts, write about projects I am working on, places I travelled to and leave notes for my future self. \
Outside the digital world, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and traveling whenever I get the chance. \
\
Over the years, Iâ€™ve gathered a collection of notes and snippets across various Computer Science topics (and a few others) â€” you can browse through them [here](../notes/). 
Itâ€™s a never-ending list, sort of like my anti-library. Maybe one day Iâ€™ll manage to read most of it!

Hello, and welcome to my teeny-tiny corner of the web!\
I have created this website to write about things I find interesting and as a note to my future self. \
I love Computers but I also like reading books, watching movies, traveling places among many other things.\
\
Over the years I have collected notes on various Computer Science related fields and other topics which can be browsed [here](../notes/). \
It's a never ending list. Hopefully, someday I would be able to read most if not all of it.

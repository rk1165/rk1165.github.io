### Notes

- Disk contention. Mailinator wrote serveral thousand log lines to memory before doing one disk write. In effect they never wanted to have contention based on the incredibly slow disk.
- The system now is one unit. The web application, the email server, and all email storage run in one JVM.

![mailinator](/images/mailinator.png)

- The emails are first compressed and then put in RAM, this saves a lot of space.

- Protocol Buffers won because it allows data to be split across different nodes; it is reusable for data other than just tweets (logs, file storage, RPC, etc); it parses efficiently; fields can be added, changed, and deleted without having to change deployed code; the encoding is small; it supports hierarchical relationships

- Experience > Projects > Education > Skills
- The goal of your bullet points is to:
  - Highlight the technical work which you have done.
  - Highlight any domains you have had exposure to (building UI, building SDKs, building web services, interacting with cloud providers, working with databases, etc.)
  - Highlight technical challenges you faced and overcame.
  - Highlight the impact of your work.
- Developed a back end web service to handle user authentication utilizing JWT and interacting with existing user services to store sessions data in a Redis cache, leading to a 14% reduction in complaints about dropped sessions
- Developed a React-Native based mobile application by collaborating with product design teams, interacting with a GraphQL API allowing users to navigate and make orders to local restaurants. Led to better user engagement according to analytics funnels
- Led the development of a data pipelines platform utilizing Kafka streams, ingesting data from various data stores from across the application. Resulted in a more streamlined developer experience for data query teams and reducing congestion by 24% during peak hours
- **Good examples**: analyzed, architected, automated, built, created, decreased, designed, developed, implemented, improved, optimized, published, reduced, refactored
- **Bad examples**: aided, assisted, coded, collaborated, communicated, executed, exposed to, gained experience, helped, participated, programmed, ran, used, utilized, worked on
- **superfluous/awkward/unnecessarily complex verbs**: amplified, conceptualized, crafted, elevated, employed, engaged, engineered, enhanced, ensured, fostered, headed, honed, innovated, mastered, orchestrated, perfected, pioneered, revolutionized, spearheaded, transformed
- How did your software interface with the stepper motors to complete task X to a desired level of precision? That's the kind of stuff that stands out and shows the reader your technical abilities.
- S - Situation, T - Task, A - Action, R - Result

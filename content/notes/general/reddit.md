### Reddit Links, Comments and Wisdom

- Don't work on "easy" things. Failing at easy things is shameful; succeeding is unremarkable. Much better to work on hard things. Failure is unfortunate but expected; success makes you a hero.
- Someone once said that the world would be a better place if people only wrote books because they had something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book
- That's what we should tell kids. Their job isn't to get good grades so they can get into a good college, but to learn and do. And not just because that's more rewarding than worldly success. That will increasingly be the route to worldly success.
- Everybody is looking for the right person, and nobody is trying to be the right person.
- When relationship is not working: When you find yourself doing things not because you want to make them happy, but to avoid them becoming angry.
- Don't marry someone you can live with marry someone you can't live without.
- An argument is when you are trying to determine **WHO** is right, a conversation is when you are trying to determine **WHAT** is right.
- Liking someone because they like you is the worst reason to like someone - you want to date people not their company.
- You will meet people that see a lot more in you than you see in yourself. It’s crazy and kind of unbelievable, but that’s what love is.
- The person in control of any relationship is the person who cares about it the least.
- Even if you're mad at each other, don't make one person sleep on the couch or whatever. Physical distance creates (and amplifies) emotional distance.

- Next year you'll wish you had started today.
- Creativity and tenacity in the face of failure will stand you in much better stead in real life than getting lots of A's in school.

- Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
- Never put a person in a position where they have to defend themselves, even when you know they're wrong.
- Focus on the path in front of you rather than the top of the mountain.
- When giving advice, use the phrase "perhaps" in replacement of "I think" so it comes off more as a suggestion and not an opinion. It will be more likely to be heard and taken into consideration.
- Apologize less, say thank you more.
  - Instead of, "I'm sorry I'm talking so much", say "thank you for listening".
  - Instead of "sorry for rescheduling" say "Thanks for being so flexible"
- Every time I see you, my day gets better.
- I think you're really beautiful and I don't know what to do about it.
- It's far more important to have compatible goals than it is to have similar interests.
- How you live each day is how you live your life.
- Silence is holy. It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking.

- If you want to know if you can trust somebody you let in your home, leave a $5 bill in a place that looks like it was forgotten about and that they would see it. If they'll take you for $5 now, they'll take you for more later.
- Attitude is the difference between an ordeal and an adventure
- Experience is the capacity to recognize a mistake when you are about to make it again.
- The strongest steel comes from the hottest fires
- Discipline is doing what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, when we don't want to do it.
- Man cannot remake him without suffering; for he is both the Marble and the sculptor.
- Compliment people behind their backs.
- Everybody shows proud when you succeed. When you give your best and come up short anyway, having someone still be proud of your effort means the absolute world.
- Never grow up, just learn to be an adult.
- If you invest time into solving for what leads to success continuously, you will reap those benefits for years to come.
- Your love isn't enough. If they can't see your worth straight away, it's not worth it to stick around and convince them. You shouldn't have to convince them to love you. And most importantly, if they're not sure what it is that they want, it's certainly not worth it to stick around, hoping they'll figure it out. All they want is what you're giving them.
- Attention. That's all you're worth to them, no matter what else they say. Never believe the words they say. Always believe the actions they take. Those never lie.
- Where there's muck, there's brass. (Meaning unpleasant work pays)
- **The Endowment Effect** - where people value things more simply because they already possess them. Consider the example of you holding a stock priced at $200. Now consider an alternate universe where you didn't own that stock but had $200 cash (plus some extra for transaction costs). Would you buy the stock? If not, you should probably consider selling it. This same thought process can be applied to nearly anything in your life: job, significant other, city in which you live. It's good for keeping you out of traps.
- Before you get married, have in-depth, planning discussions around: kids, money, housing, vacations, current debt, retirement, day to day expectations, pets, in-laws, transportation, and careers...don't assume anything. Ask the questions, ensure you are on the same page.
- The gestalt of the current zeitgeist really gives me a feeling of weltschmerz: angst is the leitmotif of modern life, punctuated only by the occasional bit of schadenfreude. Unless you're a real wunderkind, the possibility of an optimistic weltanschauung is simply verboten.
- **Probleme sind Gelegenheiten zu zeigen, was man kann** (Problems/issues/trials are opportunities to show what one can do.)
- Time isn't free - it's a finite resource and you only get so much before you die. Are you really getting as much value out of this in terms of either dollars or personal enjoyment as you put in? That's up to you to decide, but I suspect for a lot of people, they aren't.
- You don't rise to the level of your talents/motivation/discipline, you fall to the level of your habits.
- A job that fulfils their creative ambition and allows them to make something, be it computer programs, cabinets, or solutions to people's problems.
- A job that fulfils their desire to prove their abilities, be it gold winning athlete, top salesman, or just highlighting that they are highly skilled.
- A job that fulfils their want for socialisation, be it working with customers, acting as a carer for others, or having a group of regular workers they can go on lunch break with.
- A job that fulfils their need for routine, be it working on a production line, processing invoices, or just keeping things in order so things run smoothly.
- A job that fulfils their requirement for payment, be it an astronaut, a janitor, what matters isn't the job, it's that they get paid.
- The best thing for being sad is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails.
- You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn.

### Brain Hacks

- Artificial deadlines :
  - He has a clever technique for bringing tough choices to a conclusion and avoiding procrastination. This is especially useful for life changing decisions such as moving country or taking that new job.
  - To put an end to the decision making process he sets a deadline for the decision to be made. Say 6pm on Monday. At five minutes to 6 he usually doesn't know the answer but in those 5 minutes something clicks, and by 6pm the answer is always there.
- 10/10/10 rule:
  - How will he feel about the outcome 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months from now? How about 10 years from now?
- This will all be over by 6pm
  - If there's an important meeting with stakeholders, a scary appointment with the doctor or a tough chat with an employee - he simply keeps in mind the fact that by "X time", the thing will have passed and won't matter anymore.
  - If it doesn't matter after X time, chances are it probably doesn't matter now.

### Striking a conversation

- I've found the key to this is practice and the easiest way to practice is to broaden your dataset. Don’t try to strike up conversations with just people you find attractive on the train.
- I try to have a conversation with literally every person I have a one time interaction with, and the key is shared observations. Talk to the cashier about your purchases, make a joke. Talk to the person sitting next to you at the haircut place, point out the kid getting a lollipop, “Do you think we get one of those after we’re done?”
- Just look at your surroundings, find something that you can point out to the stranger that they can also observe and boom you can strike up a conversation with ease. After enough practice, and if you’re not a creep, you can do it with the cute person on the train. Shared observations really set people at ease. “Oh this person is doing the legwork for me, THEY came up with something to talk about and all I have to do is respond?” You make it easy for them to talk.
- The second key to this is not to have expectations surrounding these conversations. Sometimes the gas station attendant is having a bad day and isn’t going to get a kick out of you talking about why you’re buying six energy drinks. The cute person on the train might be taken or just not interested. Plus they’re probably used to/tired of being hit on by randos. So don’t expect anyone to be receptive to your shared observations. No one is required to give you the time of day, and if you respect that, people appreciate it.
- I’ve done this for years and it stuns my introverted friends, they think I’m an extrovert because of it but it’s just practice.
- Final semi related thought, I had a friend in high school approach me after I finished a conversation with this girl he had a major crush on, “How do you talk to girls like that?” And I was like “It’s easy once you remember that they’re people too.”

### Successful marriage

1. **Any expectation you hold for your wife, you ought to hold for yourself**. If you expect her to be fit, you ought to be fit. If you expect her to be supportive, you need to be supportive. If you want her to be frugal, you need to be frugal.
2. **Never ask your wife to do anything that you can (or should be able to) do for yourself**. This is an obvious courtesy that you ought extend to everyone, but there are a shocking number of "since you're over there..." or "since you're already up can you..." dudes on Reddit.
3. **Always be the harder working partner.** And by "work" I mean "work on the family" or "work on the relationship" or "work on the house." Most women do a lot of work that you've been trained not to see, so if you focus on being the harder working partner you'll get things about right.
4. **Later is never**. When you're living alone it's OK to do laundry or dishes or whatever later. But that's thoughtless when you share a space with others. Doing the dishes later means she'll have to do them before she can use the sink. Don't be that guy.
5. **Believe in Do-ocracy**. In a democracy, you get a say in how things happen by voicing your opinion. In a marriage, you get a say in how things happen by doing them. Whoever cooks decides what's for dinner.
6. **Set priorities.** My wife and I choose an A career and a B career. The person with the A career can work longer hours and has a responsibility to (a) make more money and (b) gun for promotion and raises. The person with the B career has a responsibility to (a) be flexible (and so handle household emergencies) and (b) aim for increased flexibility.
   - You don't need to do things that way, but everybody in a relationship needs to know what position they're playing, since a marriage will eventually accrue all kinds of responsibilities: kids, aging relatives, disability or incapacity, etc.
7. **Don't be bad at shit**. A lot of guys seem to think that being good at one thing somehow compensates for being bad at something else. No. Being a great programmer and making a ton of money does not somehow compensate for being an inattentive husband or father. In a relationship, you are way better off being OK at everything than being great at some things and terrible at others.

### Advice from Sr. Engineer

- If I'm awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.
- My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation. Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.
- Speaking of titles: early in your career, title changes up are nice. Junior to Mid. Mid to Senior. Senior to Lead. Later in your career, title changes down are nice. That way, you can get the same compensation but then get an increase when you're promoted. In other words, early in your career (<10 years), title changes UP are good because it lets you grow your skills and responsibilities. Later, title changes down are nice because it lets you grow your salary.
- Being a good engineer means knowing best practices. Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.
- If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it's time to move on.
- It's not important to do what I like. It's more important to do what I don't hate.
- The closer I am to the product, the closer I am to driving revnue, the more I feel valued regardless of how technical my work is. This has been true for even the most progressive companies.

### BestOf

- In my view, it's about finding someone who has a solid character. Respectful, kind, honest, trustworthy, loyal, generous, fair. It's also about finding someone who has good communication and problem solving skills, and knows how to keep a relationship healthy.
- They also need to have similar values and life goals. Before you commit, learn about how they handle money, whether they want kids, how they value their career, where they are willing to live etc.

### Male Fashion Advice

- White, light blue, gray, and pink are great colors for button-front shirts.
- White, gray, navy, black, and oatmeal are great colors for tees.
- Khaki/tan/caramel, olive, navy, gray, and charcoal are great colors for pants and shorts.
- Dark indigo and black are great colors for jeans.
- Leather shoes in a brown, from light tan/beige to dark brown, are easy to work with.
- Sneakers in white, gray, or black are great too.

### LifeProTips

#### Miscellaneous

- Right after someone finished a public presentation or speech, approach them and let them know they did a good job (no matter how well they actually did). There is no moment in which people are more vulnerable/more insecure then when coming off stage. They will appreciate it more than anything.
- If you want children to behave in a specific way tell them what you want from them, instead of telling them what NOT to do.
- Sometimes in life it's better to identify a bad investment, swallow your pride, admit it's just not working and cut your losses. This stands for business and relationship choices, in the long term you will be better off.
- If you start acting like the person you want to be eventually you will become that person.
- take photos of your parents doing things they do every day. When you get older, they will bring back memories more than any posed pic ever could.
- Getting angry with people for making mistakes doesn't teach them not to make mistakes, it just teaches them to hide them.
- If you're buying a home printer for occasional use, get a **laser** printer; they're more expensive up front but way more economical in the long run.
- When it is unclear whether you should use "who" or "whom" in a question, pay attention to the potential answer. If "he" sounds right in the answer then "who" is usually correct. If "him" sounds right in the answer then "whom" is usually correct.
- One of the most important questions you can ask in a debate/argument is, “What proof or evidence would it take to change your mind/opinion?” If they can’t give you an answer or if they refuse to accept the evidence that they asked for, then quit wasting your time arguing with that person.

#### Social

- Often being liked doesn't require you to be interesting/funny. It just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.
- If you get someone to talk about themselves, they'll think you're incredibly interesting.
- If you and your partner are indecisive with everyday choices (e.g dinner), try the 5, 2, 1 method. One of you pick 5, the other narrows it down to 2 and then the other picks 1. (Works really well with moves, food, tv shows, clothes etc.)
- If you really want to connect with someone, take them for a long, scenic walk. Not being face to face takes some of the pressure off, and the scenery puts you in the right mood to open up.
- If you have to cancel plans with someone, immediately ask them when they are free again in the future and make replacement plans. It makes people feel like you do really care about seeing them and you appear less flaky.
- A real, effective apology has three parts: (1) Acknowledge how your action affected the person; (2) say you're sorry; (3) describe what you're going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn't happen again. Don't excuse or explain.
- Daily use of the art of UPOD (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. Tell your S.O. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. Tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.

#### Careers & Work

- When writing a resume, make it specific to the company you are applying for. Use the specific key words they use, as many companies will use a digital resume and search for those terms.
- If recruiters ask you for your current compensation, then gently redirect them to your expected compensation or ask them for a range. (I'd like to make between x to y)
- Maintain a .txt (notepad) version of your resume, and update it whenever you modify your CV. Since most job applications requires you to enter a text version of your professional and academic experiences, you'll save time and control the formatting, as well as avoid pages timing out.
- Keep a separate master resume with ALL previous work experience. When sending out a resume for application, duplicate the file and remove anything that may be irrelevant to the position. You never know when some past experience might become relevant again, and you don’t want to forget about it.
- Instead of using the phrase "I assumed..." use the phrase "My understanding was..."
- If you're in a job interview and you're offered a glass of water, always accept. If you're asked a tough question, you can take a sip and get yourself some extra seconds to think of a response
- Instead of saying "I don't know" when your boss asks you a question say "I'll find out." It'll make them respect you more.
- Don't be fooled by the "working for a dream company" ideology. You'll be much better off with an amazing boss at an average company who champions your work, allows you to develop mastery in your field, and gives you autonomy.

#### Travel

- Say "I am learning the language" instead of "Sorry, I don't know the language" whenever moving to a new country. People are always glad to hear that you are willing to make the effort to learn their language
- Before checking in at the airport. take a photograph of your luggage. A picture is worth a thousand words if your bag gets lost!
- If you’re traveling in a foreign country where you don’t speak the language, take a business card from your hotel, and a picture of the front of the building. If you get lost and need a taxi back, you can show the picture and business card to the driver and you won’t need to speak.

#### Home & Garden

- If you cut off the crown (green part) of a pineapple and plant it, it will grow a new pineapple
- One of the first things you should do when moving into a new home is to change the locks. You never know who might have a key to the house in their possession.

#### Food & Drink

- Put a peeled banana in the freezer for a snack that almost has the same texture and taste of ice cream but without the guilt or calories.
- Eggs - Protein, Iron, Sulfur
- Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Mangos, Kale, Spinach - vitamin A
- Fish, Flax Seeds, Olive Oil, Walnuts - Omega-3s
- Bananas, Almonds, Raisins - potassium
- Cucumbers, Zucchini, Pineapple, Melon - Water
- Tomatoes, Watermelon. Strawberries, Broccoli - Antioxidants

There hath been lost the art of reading deep,
As minds grow dull and wit is lulled to sleep.
For now we feast on fragments, swift and slight,
Where reels and glimpses flash and fade from sight.
On TikTok’s stage, like poor Yorick’s faint jest,
We smile—and yet our thoughts find little rest.
The scroll doth ever wind, yet leaves no trace,
As Birnam Wood ne’er marches from its place.
What once was pondered in a quiet nook
Now dies upon the threshold of a look.
No Prospero commands the storm of thought,
For books lie closed, their wonders left unsought.
Such dainty bites, though sweet upon the tongue,
Make minds as thin as air, from depth unstrung.
But O! Give leave to sit with ink and page—
And feed the soul, like players on a stage.

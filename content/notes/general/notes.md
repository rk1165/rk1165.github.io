- An **acquired taste** is an appreciation for something unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it.
- **Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater** is an idiomatic expression for an avoidable error in which something good is eliminated when trying to get rid of something bad, or in other words, rejecting the favorable along with the unfavorable
- Alzheimer’s was caused by a buildup in the brain of **sticky protein**, or plaque, called **beta amyloid**, that interfered with communication between nerve cells.
- Anger, fear, anxiety – governed by cortisol, excitement – dopamine, comfort calming hormone serotonin.
- To maximize creativity best way is to maintain "high levels of both serotonin and dopamine"
- Minimum of 30 min – but ideally up to 2 hours of deep sleep reduces cortisol and boosts serotonin.
- Walk and talk - heart releases a peptide to help produce serotonin
- Make decisions in the morning – that's when serotonin levels will be high.
- Two neural pathways of brain:
  1. From anxiety to calm
  2. From boredom/complacency to excitement
- **Endemic:** These diseases have a constant presence in a region. Colds and seasonal flus are endemic because they are expected, as is malaria in some tropical regions.
- **Epidemics:** These often sudden outbreaks occur when the tally of new cases exceed what is expected for an infectious disease in a given region.
- **Pandemic:** Like the H1N1 flu of 2009 pandemic not only exceed expected case levels but also spread over many countries – and often many continents too.
- **Genomic diagnosis:** the Science of using genetic sequences to identify pathogens.
- Group theorists focus more on what you can do to a shape — specifically, all the ways you can change it while keeping something else about it the same. More precisely, they look for all the transformations that leave a shape unchanged, given certain constraints. These transformations are called the *symmetries* of the shape. Taken together they form a *group*, a collection of transformations whose relationships define the shape’s most basic architecture
- great circles on a sphere contain the shortest paths between any two points. They’re called *great* because they’re the largest circles you can have on a sphere
- The benefit of selling a solution rather than a product. (When selling knives door-to-door)
- Telic activities — from *telos*, the Greek word for purpose — aim at terminal states, by which they are completed. Think of reading this article or driving home from work. Once you arrive at the goal, you are finished: The point of the activity has been achieved
- Some activities are atelic: They do not aim at terminal states. However much you reflect on life or spend time with your family, you cannot complete these activities.
- To live in the present is to appreciate the value of atelic activities like going for a walk, listening to music, spending time with family or friends. It is to care about the process of what you are doing, not just projects you aim to complete.
- Regrets of the dying:
  - I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
  - I wish I didn't work so hard.
  - I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
  - I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
  - I wish that I had let myself be happier.
- Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships, be happy

### Important traits

1. **Self-Control** The ability to control and manage your own mind, body and emotions, and interactions with people is crucial. People with a high degree of self-control know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.
2. **Optimism and Positivity** Successful people do not get discouraged easily, they let their optimism drive them forward. Where others might think something is too difficult, successful people face those challenges with energy and positivity.
3. **Open-Minded** The only thing constant is change and as the years pass the people who refuse to learn, adapt and grow will be left behind. In order to be successful you need to be open to learning about new things and exploring new experiences.
4. **Think Long-Term** If you want to be successful, you can't leave that to chance. Successful people spend time planning for their future professionally, personally and financially. They think carefully before making decisions and they understand how each of those decisions impacts long-term goals.
5. **Take Risks** Failure often provides us with some of life’s biggest learning opportunities. That is why successful people embrace this as well as the uncertainty and risk that are inherent parts of becoming successful in your field.
6. **Keep Things Simple** Anyone can make something complicated. Successful people know how to keep things simple for themselves and others. This helps them manage everything easier as well as successfully delegate more to other people.
7. **Embrace Discomfort** Sometimes in life and business it can seem like things just won’t go right, then in some cases they go horribly wrong. Successful people embrace this and learn to roll with the punches by understanding there are somethings in life they can't control.
8. **Never Gives Up** Every overnight success you’ve heard about likely has another side to the story, like the burning desire of the founders to succeed and countless days/nights spent working. Successful people learn to love the process as much as the outcome and stay committed to their vision through thick and thin.
9. **Spend Time With The Right People** You’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Don't be afraid to step outside your circle to ask for help from people who have been where you are. You'll be surprised how many people are willing to help and offer advice and which ones might turn into valuable relationships.
10. **Show Gratitude** It's important to show gratitude towards others as well as your self. Many times, people focus on what they don't have, instead focus on what you do have and you'll be surprised how quickly your perspective on success and life can change.
11. **Embrace Change** Successful people know that the world is and will always continue to change. In some cases they even find ways to benefit from those changes in the world. If you want to be successful, learn how to stay ahead of the curve by studying and embracing change.
12. **Life/Work Balance** While it does take sacrifices to be successful, it's important to have balance in your life. Spend time doing things you enjoy and let yourself relax, it can be difficult for those of us who like to work tirelessly, but it's important to slow down and enjoy the journey as much as the destination.
13. **Want Others To Succeed** Successful people want to share their success with the people they care about. Business partners and customers, family and friends, employees and their families, etc. Successful act with generosity and gratitude by effecting positive change in the lives of the people around them.
14. **Have A Purpose** Many successful people are fueled by an inner drive that gives them a sense of higher purpose in life as well as the desire to build something that will not only outlive them but positively effect change the world.
15. **Share Graciously** They say the more you share, the more you get back in return (and not just in terms of money). Successful people know that it's important that they share their knowledge, resources, time and in some cases money, with the people who would benefit from it most.
16. **Accept Responsibility** You'll never hear a successful person blame someone else and in many cases, will take the blame all together for their team/organization/etc. Successful people own their failures and make a point to learn and grow from those experiences.
17. **Never Make Excuses** The one thing successful people never do is make excuses. They know how to create their own success and luck. Don't blame the government, the economy, lack of time, lack of money or anything else. If you want to be successful, stop making excusing and earn it

  3. collaboration and influence
  4. team leadership
  5. developing organizational capabilities
  6. change leadership
  7. market understanding.

### Confucius words of wisdom

1. *It doesn't matter how slowly you go as long as you don't stop.* I believe that to be true. Most successful people who have achieved great wealth and fame in their life, they didn't give up when every thing looked to fall apart.
2. Never contract friendship with a man that is not better than thyself.
3. It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.
4. To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it.
5. When anger rises, think of the consequences.
6. When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps.
7. If I am walking with two other men, each of them will serve as my teacher. I will pick out the good points of the one and imitate them and the bad points of the other and correct them in myself
8. Wherever you go, go with all you heart.
9. The expectations of life depend upon diligence; the mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools

### Good Thinking Concepts

1. **Inversion** : Thinking backwards. Often by considering what we want to avoid rather than what we want to get, we come up with better solutions. For instance it's better to avoid stupidity than seek brilliance in life.
2. **Falsification/Confimation Bias** : It feels much better to find evidence that confirms what you believe to be true than to find evidence that falsifies what you believe to be true.
3. **Circle of Competence** : Where should we devote our limited time in life, in order to achieve the most success? By developing a circle of competence.
4. **Occam's Razor** : Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
5. **Hanlon's Razor** : We should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. Applying Hanlon’s razor in our day-to-day lives, allows us to better develop relationships, become less judgmental, and improves rationality.
6. **Second-order thinking** : Second-order thinkers take into account a lot of what we put into our decision journals. Things like, What is the range of possible outcomes? What’s the probability I’m right? What’s the follow-on? How could I be wrong? The ability to risk looking like an idiot is necessary for being different. You never look like a fool if you look like everyone else.
7. **The map is not the territory** : the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality. You do not understand a model, map, or reduction unless you understand and respect its limitations.

### Thinking about Systems

1. Scale: Properties (or behaviors) tend to change when you scale them up or down
2. Law of Diminishing Returns:
3. Pareto Principle: Pareto Principle states that a small amount of some phenomenon causes a disproportionately large effect
4. Feedback Loops (and Homeostasis):
5. Chaos Dynamics (Sensitivity to Initial Conditions): small changes (perturbations) in initial conditions have massive downstream effects as near-infinite feedback loops occur
6. Preferential Attachment (Cumulative Advantage): A preferential attachment situation occurs when the current leader is given more of the reward than the laggards, thereby tending to preserve or enhance the status of the leader
7. Emergence
8. Irreducibility
9. Tragedy of the commons: in a system where a common resource is shared, with no individual responsible for the wellbeing of the resource, it will tend to be depleted over time
10. Gresham's Law: in a system of circulating currency, forged currency will tend to drive out real currency, as real currency is hoarded and forged currency is spent
11. Algorithms
12. Fragility – Robustness – Antifragility
13. Backup Systems/Redundancy
14. Margin of Safety
15. Criticality: A system becomes critical when it is about to jump discretely from one phase to another.
16. Network Effects: A network tends to become more valuable as nodes are added to the network: this is known as the network effect.
17. Black Swan
18. Via Negativa – Omission/Removal/Avoidance of Harm: In many systems, improvement is at best, or at times only, a result of removing bad elements rather than of adding good elements
19. The Lindy Effect: refers to the life expectancy of a non-perishable object or idea being related to its current lifespan. If an idea or object has lasted for X number of years, it would be expected (on average) to last another X years.
20. Renormalization Group: the application of a renormalization group to social systems allow us to understand why a small number of stubborn individuals can have a disproportionate impact if those around them follow suit on increasingly large scales
21. Spring-loading: A system is spring-loaded if it is coiled in a certain direction, positive or negative
22. Complex Adaptive Systems: one that can understand itself and change based on that understanding.

### Startups

- In fact, an easy way to find ideas (to the point where it kind of feels like a cheat code) is to see what companies in a given industry are constantly hiring for. If you can replace 10% of a job that companies pay $65,000 per year per head, you can pretty easily demand $6,500 or more. Unlike a W-2 employee, Your company does not cost your customer a full-time manager, nor does it increase administrative burden for HR, IT, or facilities, and does not incur costs such as benefits, payroll taxes, or accounting fees associated with personnel - which will undoubtedly be higher than the flat monthly or yearly line-item on the expense sheet that your business represents.
- Choose an industry, pick a pain point, build the product, price it according to what it costs, and sell to them. You typically won’t find super interesting problems to solve here but it will be reliable as long as they don’t build it themselves.
- As a solo-founder:
  1. Avoid businesses that require scale
  2. Don't charge low prices 
  3. Target Businesses : If you're a solo-founder, you need to minimize your time spent on attracting customers (because it's just you) and maximize your product price. Selling B2B solves both of these problems.
  4. Don't choose a large market
- Swap scale for small and charge higher prices to businesses.

### How to Start a Startup

- You need three things to create a successful startup:
  - to start with good people
  - to make something customers actually want
  - to spend as little money as possible.

#### Idea

- look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn't suck.
- What do people who are not like you (programmers) want from technology?
- If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers
- If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine.

#### People

- Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people.
- Who to hire? Someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.
- `Salespeople`
- For programmers three tests
  - was the person genuinely smart? Often you can recognize them by their ability to say things like "I don't know," "Maybe you're right," "I don't understand x well enough."
  - If so, could they actually get things done?
  - And could we stand to have the ones with unbearable personalities around.
- You have to have atleast one people in a startup willing and able to focus on what customers want.
- If you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can.

#### What Customers Want

- Make the technology easy to use.
- How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them
- Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it's easier to sell to them.
- It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.
- Build the simple, inexpensive option.

#### Raising Money

- To be self-funding you have to start as a consulting company, and it's hard to switch from that to a product company.
- At business plan stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you're going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders.
- When you set up the company, as well as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone's ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone's only job
- One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into IP problems. Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history. If they have signed something somewhere saying all their ideas belonged to some company they are working for.
- How much stock should angels get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you're implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company.
- Be skeptical about claims of experience and connections of VCs.
- How much to tell to VCs? The best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either.
- Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don't want their money, because
  - they may be on the board of someone who will buy you
  - if you seem impressive, they may be discouraged from investing in your competitors
- Unless you're in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage. `Look for undifferentiated web businesses`
- There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup than smart users. If you listen to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.
- Get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.
- Design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don't put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.
- You want to live at the office in a startup. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around.
- It's hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it's straightforward to avoid errors.
- The fewer people you can hire the better.
- Build something users love, and spend less than you make.

### Ideas for Startups

- The initial idea is just a starting point - not a blueprint, but a question. So start with questions. Such as could a spreadsheet service be built where the data remains on your computer but you could collaborate?
- **Start with questions** like could this be done ...., could this be modified..., if it is possible to ....
- To generate such questions you need two things:
  - to be familiar with promising new technologies
  - to have the right kind of friends.
- To have good ideas you need to be working on some problem.
- Finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it
- One way to make something people want is to _look at stuff people use now that's broken_.
- The problem is not, what operating system should people use on desktop computers? but how should people use applications?
- Another classic way to make something people want is to _take a luxury and make it into a commmodity_.
- If you make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitative changes, because people start to use it in different ways.
- Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine the problem
- The best way to solve a problem is often to redefine it
- making things easier to use. e.g financial services
- If you want to start a startup, you can _take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, and assume you could build something way easier to use_.
- You should seek out ideas that would be popular but seem hard to make money from.
- _Find something that's missing in your own life, and supply that need_ — no matter how specific to you it seems.
- Even if the problem is simply that you don't have a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by writing software, you're onto something, because a lot of other people have the same problem.
- _What do you wish someone would make for you?_
- Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want
- build-stuff-for-yourself model might be useful
- acquirers buy startups because of strategic value
- There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are going to be necessary to some class of users other than you. Apple was the first type.
- Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind.
- _What's missing or broken in your daily life?_
- Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems like the problem is important enough to build a company on.
- If you _find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you have found a gold mine_.

### Frighetningly Ambitious Startup Ideas

1. **A New Search Engine**
   - The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use.
   - Make it really good for code search (a thought)
2. **Replace Email**
   - My inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it.
   - email has to be replaced with a new protocol - a todo list protocol.
3. **Create the next wave of hardware**
4. Write software that could make a large number of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU. One way to do is to write a compiler than will parallelize our code for us.
5. **Ongoing Automatic medical diagnosis**

### How to Get Startup Ideas

- The way to get startup ideas is to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.
- Build something a small number of people want a large amount.
- When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? _Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one_? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.
- Live in the future, then build what's missing/what's interesting. One way to do that is not to take the state of the world for granted and start questioning things. Why is your inbox overflowing? Because you get a lot of email, or because it's hard to get email out of your inbox? Why do you get so much email? What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email? Are there better ways to solve them? And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox? Why do you keep emails around after you've read them? Is an inbox the optimal tool for that?
- You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. You have to be able to phrase your thesis in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking.
- So any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft)
- Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world. _What's missing? What would they like to do that they can't? What's tedious or annoying, particularly in their work?_ Let the conversation get general; don't be trying too hard to find startup ideas. You're just looking for something to spark a thought. Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously realize they had, because you know how to solve it.
- seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps
- Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes
- it's good to have the time and the inclination to build things just because they're interesting.
- Look for something no one else thinks is important at present
- The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.
- At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.

### How to Fund a Startup

- Asking money from friends and family.
- Doing some consulting job or a job.
- Angels. They'll only consider companies that have an exit strategy.
- If you're going to sell cheap stock to eminent angels, do it early, when it's natural for the company to have a low valuation.
- The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives. When an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirer says they want to buy you, _don't believe it till you get the check_
- Seed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small amounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they're companies that do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasional investments on the side.
- Idealab - generates ideas for new startups internally and hires people to work for them
- VC firms are like seed firms in that they're actual companies, but they invest other people's money, and much larger amounts of it.
- lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend to want to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide if they really want to.
- When a VC offers you a term sheet, ask how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals.
- Five fundamental questions of business plan:
  1. what they're going to do
  2. why users need it
  3. how large the market is
  4. how they'll make money
  5. who the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them.

### The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn

1. **Release Early**
   - Get a verson 1 out fast, then improve it based on the users' reactions.
2. **Keep Pumping out Features**
   - the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be. Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements
3. **Make Users Happy**
   - explain as concisely as possible, what the hell is your site about.
   - A startup should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does.
4. **Fear the Right Things**
   - You should compete against what someone else _could_ be doing, not just what you can see people doing.
   - three main ways startups hose themselves: internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users.
   - You will find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.
5. **Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**
   - The most important quality in a startup founder is determination.
6. **There Is Always Room**
   - There is always room for new stuff.
   - The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are, and assume that's how things have to be.
   - Startups make wealth, which means they make things people want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want, we are nowhere near it.
7. **Don't Get Your Hopes Up**
   - You should treat your optimism the way you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous. You have to build a shield around it, or it will fry you.
   - What's important about startups is the speed. By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect for life, and there is something grand about that.

- The most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe. They're like undervalued stocks. If you start with them, you'll have the whole field to yourself.
- To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured. And you have to have leverage. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure.
- When you know nothing, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, and if you're smart your reinventions may be better than what preceded them.
- Most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming technique. It's a knack for understanding users and figuring out how to give them what they want.
- If you pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges involved.
- To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big market.
- For a company to grow really big, it must:
  - make something lots of people want
  - reach and serve all those people
- What you're looking for initially is not so much a great idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one
- What we look for in Founders
  - **Determination**: Not getting demoralized easily
  - **Flexibility**: Not to stick with one dream.
  - **Imagination**
  - **Naughtiness**
  - **Friendship**: relationship among the founders has to be strong.

### What You'll wish You'd Known

- You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.
- Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.
- If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question.
- Find a question that makes the world interesting.

### The Anatomy of Determination

- In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination — partly because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination starts to look like talent.
- The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness. When you want something, you must have it, no matter what.
- Determination implies your willfulness is balanced by discipline.
- There's one other major component of determination: ambition. If willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination, ambition is how you choose it.

### Great Hackers

- The hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.
- Great hackers think of programming as something they do for fun.
- Great hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools.
- Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.
- Hackers want interesting projects
- The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.
- Hackers are particularly curious, especially about how things work.
- Maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.

### How to Do What You Love

- The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It means do what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.
- To be happy you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire.
- You have to be able to say at the end, wow, that's pretty cool.
- The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it.
- One has to make a living, and it's hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to that destination:
  - **The organic route**: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don't.
  - **The two-job route**: to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things you do.
- It's also wise, to seek jobs that let you do many different things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.

### Hackers and Painters

- What hackers and painters have in common is that they're both makers.
- Hackers need to understand the theory of computation. You need to know how to calculate time and space complexity and about Turing completeness. You must also remember the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write a parser or a regular expression library.
- You can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product.
- Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one.
- Part of what software has to do is explain itself. To write good software you have to understand how little users understand.
- Programming languages should be designed to express algorithms.

### Taste for Makers

- Good design:
  - is simple.
  - is timeless. Aiming at timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer. If you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations.
  - solves the right problem. In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced by an equivalent one that's easy to solve.
  - is suggestive.
  - is often slightly funny.
  - is hard. Hard problems call for great efforts.
  - looks easy.
  - uses symmetry. There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.
  - resembles natures.
  - is redesign.
  - can copy. The second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality.
  - is often strange. The only style worth having is the one you can't help.
  - happens in chunks. Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems.
  - is often daring. Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees something and thinks, _I could do better than that_. You have to understand a field well before you develop a good nose for what needs fixing.

### Do Things that don't Scale

- Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of potential users.
- The big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself.
- The question to ask about an early stage startup is not "is this company taking over the world?" but "how big could this company get if the founders did the right things?"
- recruit users manually and give them an overwhelmingly good experience
- Use your software on users's behalf

### How to be successful

1. Compound yourself
   - You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty. As your career progresses each unit of work you do should generate more and more results.
   - Biggest competitive advantage is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.
2. Have almost too much self-belief
3. Learn to think Independently
4. Get good at "sales"
5. Make it easy to take risks
6. Focus
7. Work hard
8. Be bold
9. Be willful : A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.
10. Be hard to compete with
11. Build a network : An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.
12. You get rich by owning things.
13. Be internally driven: It is hard to be wildly successfuly at anything you aren't obsessed with.

### Startups in 13 sentences:

1. Pick good cofounders
2. Launch fast
3. Let your idea evolve
4. Understand your users
5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.
6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.
7. You make what you measure.
8. Spend little
9. Get Ramen profitable: "Ramen profitable" means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses.
10. Avoid distractions
11. Don't get demoralized
12. Don't give up
13. Deals fall through : so don't get your hopes high

### Six pinciples for Making New things

- Find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.

### Beating the Averages

- Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects. Lisp code, after it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.
- A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful.
- If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.
- Gradualness is very powerful. And that power can be used for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into creating something so grand that you would never have dared to plan such a thing. Indeed, this is just how most good software gets created. You start by writing a stripped-down kernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows into a complete operating system. Hence the next leap: could you do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?

### How to make wealth?

- To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.
- A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss.
- If you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.
- Technology = leverage. That's the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage.
- If you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice.
- If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you're trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you're even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.
- Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users.
- If you're free of a misconception that everyone else still shares, you're in a powerful position.

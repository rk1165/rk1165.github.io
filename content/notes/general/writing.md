### Six ways to achieve conciseness

1. Avoid redundancy. The words in the parentheses aren't necessary.
   - ten p.m. (at night)
   - tall (in height)
   - our (final) conclusion
   - (the month of) June
   - square (in shape)
   - to combine (together)
   - to ask (a question)
   - a consensus (of opinion)
2. Watch out for wordy phrases.

| Wordy                     | Concise     |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| based on the fact that    | because     |
| despite the fact that     | although    |
| in the event that         | if          |
| at the present time       | now         |
| until such a time as      | until       |
| on a weekly basis         | weekly      |
| it is often the case that | often       |
| have the ability to       | can         |
| during the course of      | during      |
| take under consideration  | consider    |
| to be of the opinion      | to think    |
| to make reference to      | to refer to |
| in the final analysis     | finally     |

3. Make your subject clear and defined.
   - Unclear: The practice of revision would improve our writing
   - Clear : Revision would improve our writing
   - Avoid empty subjects _it_ and _there_ (called _expletives_) when possible
   - Empty: There is no way to become a better writer than to practice.
   - Define: We can become better writers if we practice
4. Use strong verbs.
   - to be \_ nouns : What we found was a solution to the problem.
   - Strong verb : We solved the problem.
5. Avoid vague words. Words like "thing", "stuff", "material", "people", "get", or "did" should be replaced with precise nouns and verbs.
   - Vague: I needed to get some stuff at the store.
   - Clear: I needed to buy some groceries at the farmer's market.
6. Remove unnecessary modifiers. Look for modifiers like "many," "really," "quite," "in my opinion," and so on, and edit them out of your writing.
   - Unnecessary: In my opinion, that movie was really quite good. I'm very glad we saw it
   - Concise: That movie was fantastic! I'm glad we saw it.

### Guidelines

- The subject of a sentence could be a noun, a pronoun, or even another sentence.
- The subject is what (or whom) the sentence is about, and the predicate says something about the subject.
- A phrase is a group of words that may have nouns or verbs, but there is no subject doing anything.
- A clause is a group of words that has a subject that is doing something. If the clause can stand by itself, and form a complete sentence, it is an independent clause. Dependent clauses have a subject doing something, but they have a subordinate conjunction at the beginning of the clause. That subordinate conjunction means that the clause can't stand by itself as a complete sentence.
- A good paragraph is organized so that makes sense to the reader. Each sentence leads logically to the next, and is connected through transition words or other connecting words. In addition to a topic sentence and a main idea, an effective paragraph is coherent and develops its idea.
- You can help create coherence in your paragraphs by using logical and verbal connections. You can develop logical connections by making sure that each sentence in a paragraph relates in some way to the topic sentence.
- Development refers to the support you have for your topic sentence.
  - Use examples
  - Give data (for example, statistics, data, information, examples)
  - Quote others, either directly or through paraphrasing
  - Tell a story
  - Define your key words
  - Compare or contrast ideas
  - Examine causes and effects
- In writing, a signpost helps readers find their way; it can be a phrase, sentence, or paragraph that explains to the reader where the writer has been, or where the writer is going.
  - The purpose of this paper is...
  - The previous research has shown...
  - The next section will illustrate...
- Transitions are phrases or sentences that help you move from from one idea to the next. Transitions are often used at the ends of paragraphs to create a connection between ideas, from one paragraph to the next.
  - moreover
  - nevertheless
  - in addition
  - similarly
  - on the other hand
  - in conclusion
- In order to create a thesis, you have to add an opinion, or point of view that is _arguable_ or open to interpretation to your topic.
  - The hunting of wolves in Arctic should be stopped because of the danger of the wolf's extinction.
- In informal outlines, you organize your notes into sections that correspond to different parts of your essay.
- Formal outlines have the same concept behind them as informal ones, but they have specific formats. Formal outlines have more details than informal outlines, and formal outlines also use certain methods of showing relationships between ideas.
- Another type of organization is something called a 'mind map' or a graphic organizer. This type of organization presents a more "graphic" (rather than textual) way of organizing your ideas.

### On writing

- Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something. With a passive verb, something is being done _to_ the subject of the sentence.
- You should avoid the passive tense.
- The adverb is not your friend.
- In insist that you use the adverb in dialouge attribution only in the rarest and most special of occasions ... and not even then, if you can avoid it.
- When readers recognize the people in a book, their behaviors, their surroundings, and their talk. When the reader hears strong echoes of his or her own life and beliefs, he or she is apt to become more invested in the story.
- Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work. Especially work. People love to read about work.
- Stories and novels consists of three parts: narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and dialouge, which brings characters to life through their speech.
- Good fiction always begins with story and progressive to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story.
- The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn't very interesting. Stick to the parts that are
- It is, after all, the dab of grit that seeps into an oyster's shell that makes the pearl, not pearl-making seminars with other oysters.

### Grammar

- **Among/between**: Among is used to refer to relationships involving more than two objects. Between is used to refer to relationships involving only two objects.
- **As/like**: As can be a preposition meaning "in the capacity of," but more often is a conjunction of manner and is followed by a verb. Like is generally used as a preposition, and therefore is followed by a noun, an object pronoun, or a verb ending in ‐ ing.
- **Mass and count words**: Mass words are nouns quantified by an amount rather than by a number. Count nouns can be quantified by a number
- Pronouns: _Myself_ should not be used as a substitute for I or me
- Word combinations such as "not only ... but also" should be followed by an element of the same grammatical type.
- _Fewer_ refers to a specific number, whereas
  _less than_ refers to a continuous quantity. _Between ... and_ is the correct form to designate a choice. _Farther_ refers to distance, whereas _further_ refers to degree.

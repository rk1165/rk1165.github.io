#### Conditions and criteria to consider in the search for mistakes and inefficiencies.

- **Klarman - Where to Find Investment Opportuinities**
- Spin-offs
- Forced selling by index funds
- Forced selling by institutions (e.g. big MFs selling "tainted" names)
- Disaster de jour (e.g accounting fraud, earnings disappointment, etc; adversity and uncertainty create opportunity)
- Graham-and-Dodd deep value (e.g discount to break-up value, P/CF < 10x)
- Catalyst (e.g tender, Dutch auction, other special situations)
- Real estate
- **Forced selling**
  - Downgrades, index additions/removals, bankruptcies, margin calls, liquidations, spinoffs.
- **NCAV** - market cap < 2/3 (current assets - total liabilities)
- **ROIC** = operating income / (Total assets - (Intangibles + Cash))
- Investors must understand the cyclical nature of markets and the economy.
- Buy solid companies currently cut of market favour, as measured by their low p/e, p/cf or p/bv or by their high yields.
- I find it helpful to buy near the low of the past few years. A stock may go as high as 125 and then decline to 60 and you think it attractive. 3 years before the stock sold at 20 which shows that there is some vulnerability in it.
- Generally it is harder to keep money than to make it.
- The single most important indicator of a good business is its return on capital.
- The ability to earn a high return on capital means that the earnings which are not paid out as dividends but rather retained in the business are likely to be re-invested at a high rate of return to provide for good future earnings and equity growth with low capital requirement.
- It pays to emphasize companies which have the ability to generate a large portion of their earnings in cash.

#### Short selling

- What we define as a bubble is any kind of debt fueled asset inflation, where the cash flow generation from the asset doesn't cover the debt service.
- LBOs/acquisitions/M&A make good short targets

#### Four sources of Economic Moats

- Economies of scale and scope (walmart, cintas)
- Network effect (eBay, Visa, American Express)
- IPR (Disney, Nike, Genentech)
- High switching costs for customers (Paychex, MSFT)
- Profit Potential must be > 50%
- Write down a one-or-two-sentence reason for buying an asset _before_ buying it. Review it periodically.
- Where is the paradigm shift?
- The consensus view is that in 1/3/5/10 years this company/industry will be at X. If you think the answer is different than X, the further away it is from X the better the investment opportunity will be.
- Remember that this stock must go up more than 14 percent just for you to break even after 2 percent commissions and 10% capital gain taxes. On short-term trades, you need more than 50 percent.
- Write down three reasons - having nothing to do with the stock price - why you want to be the owner of this business.
- Do I understand he business? And by understand it, I mean have a reasonably good idea of what it will look like in five or ten years from an economic standpoint.
- CATALYST- should explain what action, event, situation or future realization will cause the market to recognize the value discrepancy that you observe. Examples could include an impending regulatory/legal change, expected sale/merger, spin-off, split-off, restructuring, large buyback, product introduction, management change, or other. Sometimes no catalyst is identifiable, but value discrepancy is too large to ignore.
- Never lose sight of the facts that investing is both probabilistic and mean reverting

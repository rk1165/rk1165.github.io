### Pairs trade

- The strategy monitors performance of two historically correlated securities. When the correlation between the two securities temporarily weakens, i.e. one stock moves up while the other moves down, the pairs trade would be to short the outperforming stock and to long the underperforming one, betting that the "spread" between the two would eventually converge.
- It helps to hedge sector and market risk. It is largely self-funding.
- Competing companies in the same sector make natural potential pairs.
- A general or sector index portfolio (ETF) might be used as one component of a pair.
- Correlations can be computed for 50days, 100days, 1year. Check prices are how much std. dev. above or below 1 year avg (or some other number of days)
- Both companies fundamentals should be similar - to look for in a pairs trade.

### Mean Reversion

- In finance, mean reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move to the average price over time.
- Using mean reversion in stock price analysis involves both identifying the trading range for a stock and computing the average price using analytical techniques taking into account considerations such as earnings, etc.
- When the current market price is less than the average price, the stock is considered attractive for purchase, with the expectation that the price will rise. When the current market price is above the average price, the market price is expected to fall. In other words, deviations from the average price are expected to revert to the average.

### Ten Attributes

- You calculate FCF by starting with cash earnings and subtracting the investments a company makes to generate future earnings.
- Investments include
  - increases in working capital
  - capex above and beyond what is needed to maintain plant and equipment
  - acquisitions
- The second goal of financial statement analysis is to make a link between company's strategy and how it creates value. One simple way to do this is to compare, line by line, two companies that are in the same business.
- You can do a simpler analysis just by looking at the path to return on invested capital (ROIC). You can break ROIC into two components:
  - profitability (net operating profit after tax/sales)
  - capital velocity (sales/invested capital).
- Companies with high operating profit margins and low capital velocity are generally pursuing what Michael Porter calls a **differentiation** strategy.
- Companies with low operating profit margins and high capital velocity are following a **cost leadership** strategy.
- Great fundamental investors focus on understanding the magnitude and sustainability of free cash flow. Factors that an investor must consider include where the industry is in its life cycle, a company’s competitive position within its industry, barriers to entry, the economics of the business, and management’s skill at allocating capital.
- Great investors can explain clearly how a company makes money, have a grasp on the changes in the drivers of profitability, and never own the stock of a company if they do not understand how it makes money.
- Albert Einstein’s point that _success comes from curiosity, concentration, perseverance and self-criticism. And by self-criticism, he meant the ability to change his mind so that he destroyed his own best-loved ideas_
- Volatility is high; hence the premiums are attractive for an options seller. When volatility drops premiums drop and buy back the option
- **MDA** - The most standard way for any company to start this section is by talking about the macro trends in the economy. They discuss the overall economic activity of the country and the business sentiment across the corporate world. If the company has high exposure to exports, they even talk about global economic and business sentiment. Following this, companies talk about trends in the industry and what they expect for the year ahead. Read through this and compare it with its peers to understand if the company has any advantage over its peers. Then it talks about how the business had performed across various divisions, how did it fare in comparison to the previous year etc. Some companies discuss their guidelines and strategies for the year ahead across the various verticals they operate in.
- **Stock in trade** refers to finished goods of previous financial year being sold in this financial year.
- Reserves are usually money earmarked by the company for specific purposes. Surplus is where all the profits of the company reside.
- Deferred tax liability arises due to the treatment of depreciation.
- **Long term provisions** are usually money set aside for employee benefits such as gratuity; leave encashment, provident funds etc.
- Current Work In Progress includes building under construction, machinery under assembly etc at the time of preparing the balance sheet.
- `Net Block = Gross block - Accumulated depreciation`
- **Operational activities (OA):** Activities that are directly related to the daily core business operations are called operational activities. Typical operating activities include sales, marketing, manufacturing, technology upgrade, resource hiring etc.
- **Investing activities (IA):** Activities pertaining to investments that the company makes with an intention of reaping benefits at a later stage. Examples include parking money in interest bearing instruments, investing in equity shares, investing in land, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other non current assets etc.
- **Financing activities (FA):** Activities pertaining to all financial transactions of the company such as distributing dividends, paying interest to service debt, raising fresh debt, issuing corporate bonds etc.
- Liabilities increase -> Cash balance also increases and vice versa
- Assets increase -> Cash balance decreases and vice versa
- A well managed company finances the current assets by current liabilities.
- Pay attention to the way depreciation is treated. Provision for lesser depreciation can boost earnings.
- If the company’s earnings are increasing but not its cash flows and sales, then clearly something is not right.
- Oil and gas stocks are broken down into three parts:
  1. Upstream
  2. Midstream
  3. Downstream
- **Upstream** refers to E&P
- **Midstream** includes storing, transporting and marketing of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
- **Downstream**, which is the refining of crude and the distribution of its byproducts.
- The gross refining margin GRM is the difference between the total value of petroleum products coming out of an oil refinery (output) and the price of the raw material, (input) which is crude oil.
- The margins are calculated on a per-barrel basis.
- GRM is typically expressed in US dollars per barrel.
- In India automobiles, cement, steel, aluminium are examples of oligopolistic market.
- Aviation, Telecom, Oil, Steel and Cement - still held by a few top players
- Defensive, low-growth and interest-rate sensitive sectors, such as utilities, consumer staples and REITs.
- Identifying strong businesses typically monopolies or oligopolies that can be bought at very attractive cash flow multiples.
- In theory and under steady-state normal market conditions, one would expect a sector with high growth, a pristine balance sheet and high ROIC to trade at a valuation premium, not a discount, to the market.
- Some companies real estate holdings are worth more than the stock price.
- NALCO, Hind Copper, MECL looking to acquire lithium from Bolivia
- Taking on debt is not a problem so long as there is sufficient cash flow, after expenses, to service the debt.
- The real estate, healthcare and Pharmaceutical, materials sectors represent a large share of bonds from company with interest coverage ratio below threshold
- In addition half of telecom companies have interest coverage below threshold.
- It can be helpful to make a historical comparison between mcap and equity to see for a trend
- At the root of value investing is the belief, first espoused by Benjamin Graham, that the market is a voting machine and not a weighing machine. Thus an investor must have more confidence in his or her own opinion than in the combined weight of all other opinions.
- Normally when futures were trading far enough below the index itself, the arbitrageurs sold short a basket of stocks that closely tracked the index and bought an offsetting position in the cheaper index futures. (Say S&P index futures trading at 185 to 90 and the corresponding index at 220)
- When the price of the futures and that of the basket of underlying stocks converged, as they do later when the futures contracts settle, the arbitrageur closes out the hedge and captures the original spread as a profit
- Seeking to identify the factors that were strongly correlated to a stock's price movement as opposed to looking at all the fundamentals.
- Liquidity is the expansion and contraction of money, specifically credit. It's the biggest variable that drives demand in an economy.
- Petrol prices increase - leading to many knock-on price rise in goods and services.
- Three big drivers of inflation in rich world:
  1. The prices of imports.
  2. Capacity pressures in the domestic economy.
  3. Public's expectations.
- Big Mac Index is built on the idea of PPP, the theory that in the long run currencies will converge until the same amount of money buys the same amount of goods and services in every country.
- If prices rises faster, pressure will mount on Fed to increase interest rates. Dollar will soar. Emerging markets having large dollar debts may buckle.
- Six types of companies:
  1. **Corporate Fundamentalists:** Boosting their profits and share price - immediately - is their goal. Firms built on these objectives rarely do well for long.
  2. **Corporate Toilers:** Believe in primacy of shareholder values but are prepared to be more patient. At their best these firms are consistently successful. Think of Shell or Intel.
  3. **Corporate Oracles:** Want to maximize profits within the law. They do things today that may be required tomorrow. Energy firms have become greener. Soft-drinks firms may be next. Coal and Nuclear energy firms collpased.
  4. **Corporate Kings:** Creating shareholder value successfully. J.P. Morgan, Unilever.
  5. **Corporate Socialists:** Firms controlled by state, families or dominant managers. Shareholder value is not as important as social objectives. Profits are set according to an informal quota system - outside shareholders should get the minimum required to avoid a revolt. Goldman.
  6. On the far left are **Corporate apostates** don't care about shareholder at all. Result of political dysfunction. Fannie, Freddie, PDVSA.
- Firms become corporate socialists if they have controlling owners who demand they prioritize social objectives.
- Zombie firms are those aged ten years or older with an interest-coverage ratio (the ratio of operating income to interest expenses) of less than 1 in each of the preceding three years.
- Higher yields in advanced economies draw capital from emerging markets putting pressure on their currencies.
- Global firms have big overheads; complex supply chains tie up inventory
- Qualcomm owns 1000s of patents of technology deemed essential to build phones compatible with wireless standards.
- NuScale Power (Small Modular Reactor less than 300W)
- Tax cuts will improve economic growth (good for equities) but widen the budget deficit and push up inflation (bad for bonds)
- Habits of short termist firms:
  1. Investing relatively little.
  2. Cutting costs to boost margins.
  3. Initiating lots of buy-backs.
  4. Booking sales before customers pay.
  5. Hitting quarterly profit forecasts.
- **zero-based budgeting**, a technique that requires managers to justify every dollar of spending from scratch each year and reinvest only some of the savings in the best brands.
- 3G is expert at *zero-based budgeting* - a technique that involves scrutinizing consumer firms' bloated costs. But its magic rests on two simple insights formed decades ago.
  - First, it noted that although the cost of debt financing was low, the yield on consumer firms; shares was quite high, meaning a juicy spread.
  - Second, conventional managers underestimated how resilient consumer-product firms' sales are thanks to strong brands and oligopolistic market shares.
- 3G took advantage of a time when rates were low, stock markets were cheap, protectionist instincts subdued, anger over job losses muted and digital competition still nascent.
- Future equity returns can come from only two sources - growth in profits, or the market's placing a higher valuation on those profits.
- The difference between yields on short-term and ten-year bonds, typically turns negative before recessions.
- Budget airlines like Ryanair have long since decoupled flying from the services and amenities that usually accompanied it. Passengers have to pay separately for the extras, like seat selection and the carrying of baggage
- *Experience good* whose quality can be judged only once consumed.
- *Credence good* that buyers find hard to judge immediately.


a lower forward P/E ratio may indicate a stock is undervalued relative to its future earnings potential.

A PEG lower than 1.0 is best, suggesting that a company is relatively undervalued.

VOO + VXUS + AVUV = Best Risk-Adjusted Returns and taking compensated risk.


Don't do VOO and QQQ / QQQM if you want some extra tech exposure get VGT or FTEC. Way less overlap. Over 83% of QQQ is in VOO you will just be adding concentration to mag 7 stocks and paying more fees
FTEC or VGT gets you new 230 to 256 tech stocks not in VOO
I would just buy SCHX and VGT or FTEC call it good.
VOO is fine but SCHX has more stocks and has performed a bit better.

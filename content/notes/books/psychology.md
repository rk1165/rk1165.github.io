### Flow

- The function of consciousness is to represent information about what is happening outside and inside the organism in such a way that it can be evaluated and acted upon by the body.
- In this sense, it functions as a clearinghouse for sensations, perceptions, feelings, and ideas, establishing priorities among all the diverse information
- The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer
- It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information—such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or recognizable nuances of emotion or thought—at any one time, and that the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and another is about 1/18 of a second
- It is attention that selects the relevant bits of information from the potential millions of bits available. It takes attention to retrieve the appropriate references from memory, to evaluate the event, and then to choose the right thing to do.
- It is when we act freely, for the sake of the action itself rather than for ulterior motives, that we learn to become more than what we were. When we choose a goal and invest ourselves in it to the limits of our concentration, whatever we do will be enjoyable.
- To improve life one must improve the quality of experience.
- To gain personal control over the quality of experience, however, one needs to learn how to build enjoyment into what happens day in, day out.
- The phenomenology of enjoyment has eight major components:
  - **First**, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing.
  - **Second** we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing.
  - **Third and fourth**, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback.
  - **Fifth**, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life.
  - **Sixth**, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions.
  - **Seventh**, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over.
  - **Finally**, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours.
- What people enjoy is not the sense of being in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult situations. It is not possible to experience a feeling of control unless one is willing to give up the safety of protective routines. Only when a doubtful outcome is at stake, and one is able to influence that outcome, can a person really know whether she is in control
- When the experience is _autotelic_, the person is paying attention to the activity for its own sake; when it is not, the attention is focused on its consequences
- **Autotelic activity:** refers to a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply because the doing itself is the reward. Opposite is exotelic (done for external reasons)
- There are two strategies we can adopt to improve the quality of life. The first is to try making external conditions match out goals The second is to change how we experience external conditions to make them fit our goals better.
- The most important trait of survivors is a “nonself-conscious individualism,” or a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking enjoyment, as we have seen, does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do it.
- Wonder - which is the seed of knowledge - is the reflection of the purest form of pleasure. **Francis Bacon**

### Predictably Irrational

- Humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. We don't have an internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather, we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another, and estimate value accordingly. (For instance, we don't know how much a six-cylinder car is worth, but we can assume it's more expensive than the four-cylinder model)
- Most people don't know what they want unless they see it in context
- We are always looking at the things around us in relation to others
- We not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable—and avoid comparing things that cannot be compared easily
- The more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the cycle of relativity.
- In order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.
- The basic idea of arbitrary coherence is this: although initial prices (such as the price of As­sad's pearls) are "arbitrary," once those prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices (this makes them "coherent").
- **Self-herding** - This happens when we believe something is good (or bad) on the basis of our own previous behavior.
- The critical issue arises when F R E E ! becomes a struggle between a free item and another item—a struggle in which the presence of F R E E ! leads us to make a bad decision
- Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is F R E E ! we forget the downside, F R E E ! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is. Why? I think it's because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss
- We live in two worlds: one characterized by social exchanges and the other characterized by market exchanges. And we apply different norms to these two kinds of relationships
- If you tell people up front that something might be distasteful, the odds are good that they will end up agreeing with you—not because their experience tells them so but because of their expectations
- Expectations can influence nearly every aspect of our life

### The Happiness Hypothesis

- We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know.
- Freud said that the mind is divided into three parts: the ego (the conscious, rational self); the superego (the conscience, a sometimes too rigid commitment to the rules of society); and the id (the desire for pleasure, lots of it, sooner rather than later)
- The left hemisphere is specialized for language processing and analytical tasks. In visual tasks, it is better at noticing details. The right hemisphere is better at processing patterns in space, including that all-important pattern, the face.
- That people will readily fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior, is called **confabulation**.
- Hypothalamus (specialized to coordinate basic drives and motivations), the hippocampus (specialized for memory), and the amygdala (specialized for emotional learning and responding). These structures are sometimes referred to as the _limbic system_ (from Latin limhus, "border" or "margin") because they wrap around the rest of the brain, forming a border.
- Neocortex (Latin for "new covering") is the gray matter characteristic of human brains
- The front portion of the neocortex is particularly interesting, for parts of it do not appear to be dedicated to specific tasks (such as moving a finger or processing sound). Instead, it is available to make new associations and to engage in thinking, planning, and decision making
- The lower third of the prefrontal cortex is called orbitofrontal cortex because it is the part of the brain just above the eyes (orbit is the Latin term for the eye socket). This region of the cortex has grown especially large in humans and other primates and is one of the most consistently active areas of the brain during emotional reactions
- Events in the world affect us only through our interpretations of them, so if we can control our interpretations, we can control our world.
- The sympathetic system prepares your body for "fight or flight" and the parasympathetic system calms you down
- All neural impulses from the eyes and ears go first to the thalamus, a kind of central switching station in the brain. From the thalamus, neural impulses are sent out to special sensory processing areas in the cortex; and from those areas, information is relayed to the frontal cortex, where it is integrated with other higher mental processes and your ongoing stream of consciousness. If at the end of this process you become aware of a hissing snake in front of you, you could decide to run away and then order your legs to start moving.
- The amygdala, sitting just under the thalamus, dips into the river of unprocessed information flowing through the thalamus, and it responds to patterns that in the past were associated with danger
- It is easy to see the faults of others, but difficult to see one's own faults. One shows the faults of others like chaff winnowed in the wind, but one conceals one's own faults as a cunning gambler conceals his dice
- As Robert Wright put it in his masterful book The Moral Animal, "Human beings are a species splendid in their array of moral equipment, tragic in their propensity to misuse it, and pathetic in their constitutional ignorance of the misuse."
- The great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities, and are often more influenced by the things that seem than by those that are. Nic Machia
- Thinking generally uses the "makes - sense" stopping rule. We take a position, look for evidence that supports it, and if we find some evidence—enough so that our position "makes sense" — we stop thinking
- Over and over again, studies show that people set out on a cognitive mission to bring back reasons to support their preferred belief or action
- We judge others by their behavior, but we think we have special information about ourselves — we know what we are "really like" inside, so we can easily find ways to explain away our selfish acts and cling to the illusion that we are better than others.
- **Naive realism**: Each of us thinks we see the world directly, as it really is. We further believe that the facts as we see them are there for all to see, therefore others should agree with us. If they don't agree, it follows either that they have not yet been exposed to the relevant facts or else that they are blinded by their interests and ideologies
- Violence and cruelty have four main causes. The first two are obvious attributes of evil: greed/ambition (violence for direct personal gain, as in robbery) and sadism (pleasure in hurting people). The two biggest causes of evil are two that we think are good, and that we try to encourage in our children: high self-esteem and moral idealism. Having high self-esteem doesn't directly cause violence, but when someone's high esteem is unrealistic or narcissistic, it is easily threatened by reality; but to really get a mass atrocity going you need idealism - the belief that your violence is a means to a moral end
- Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance that he himself has spun. That is, the world we live in is not really one made of rocks, trees, and physical objects; it is a world of insults, opportunities, status symbols, betrayals, saints, and sinners. All of these are human creations which, though real in their own way, are not real in the way that rocks and trees are real.
- Finding fault with yourself is also the key to overcoming the hypocrisy and judgmentalism that damage so many valuable relationships.
- Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.
- Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing
- There are two fundamentally different kinds of externals: the conditions of your life and the voluntary activities that you undertake. Conditions include facts about your life that you can't change (race, sex, age, disability) as well as things that you can (wealth, marital status, where you live). Conditions are constant over time, at least during a period in your life, and so they are the sorts of things that you are likely to adapt to. Voluntary activities, on the other hand, are the things that you choose to do, such as meditation, exercise, learning a new skill, or taking a vacation.
- Happiness formula: H = S + C + V
- The level of happiness that you actually experience (H) is determined by your biological set point (S) plus the conditions of your life ( C ) plus the voluntary activities (V) you do.
- The wise man chooses not the greatest quantity of food but the most tasty.
- Passionate love is a wildly emotional state in which tender and sexual feelings, elation and pain, anxiety and relief, altruism and jealousy coexist in a confusion of feelings
- Companionate love grows slowly over the years as lovers apply their attachment and caregiving systems to each other, and as they begin to rely upon, care for, and trust each other. If the metaphor for passionate love is fire, the metaphor for companionate love is vines growing, intertwining, and gradually binding two people together.
- If you are in passionate love and want to celebrate your passion, read poetry. If your ardor has calmed and you want to understand your evolving relationship, read psychology. But if you have just ended a relationship and would like to believe you are better off without love, read philosophy.
- People benefit from adversity in three primary ways:
  - The first benefit is that rising to a challenge reveals your hidden abilities, and seeing these abilities changes your self-concept.
  - The second class of benefit concerns relationships. Adversity is a filter
  - This change in ways of relating points to the third common benefit: Trauma changes priorities and philosophies toward the present ("Live each day to the fullest") and toward other people.
- Most of the life goals that people pursue at the level of "characteristic adaptations" can be sorted - as the psychologist Robert Emmons has found - into four categories: work and achievement, relationships and intimacy, religion and spirituality, and generativity (leaving a legacy and contributing something to society)
- We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world.
- Knowledge comes in two major forms: explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge is all the facts you know and can consciously report, independent of context. Explicit knowledge is taught directly in schools. Tacit knowledge is procedural (it's "knowing how" rather than "knowing that"), it is acquired without direct help from others, and it is related to goals that a person values
- Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again, and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him. And a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers
- Kant believed that human beings have a dual nature: part animal and part rational. The animal part of us follows the laws of nature, just as does a falling rock or a lion killing its prey. There is no morality in nature; there is only causality. But the rational part of us, Kant said, can follow a different kind of law: It can respect rules of conduct, and so people (but not lions) can be judged morally for the degree to which they respect the right rules. What might those rules be? Here Kant devised the cleverest trick in all moral philosophy. He reasoned that for moral rules to be laws, they had to be universally applicable. If gravity worked differently for men and women, or for Italians and Egyptians, we could not speak of it as a law. But rather than searching for rules to which all people would in fact agree (a difficult task, likely to produce only a few bland generalities), Kant turned the problem around and said that people should think about whether the rules guiding their own actions could reasonably be proposed as universal laws. If you are planning to break a promise that has become inconvenient, can you really propose a universal rule that states people ought to break promises that have become inconvenient? Endorsing such a rule would render all promises meaningless. Nor could you consistently will that people cheat, lie, steal, or in any other way deprive other people of their rights or their property, for such evils would surely come back to visit you. This simple test, which Kant called the **Categorical Imperative** was extraordinarily powerful.
- The ultimate goal of all legislation, he concluded, was the good of the people; and the more good, the better. Bentham was the father of utilitarianism, the doctrine that in all decision making (legal and personal), our goal should be the maximum total benefit (utility), but who gets the benefit is of little concern
- Descendants of Kant (known as "deontologists" from the Greek deon, obligation)
- Descendants of Bentham (known as "consequentialists" because they evaluate actions only by their consequences)
- Parsimony: Decisions should be based ultimately on one principle only, be it the categorical imperative or the maximization of utility
- On nearly all lists: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence (the ability to forge connections to something larger than the self)
- There are twenty-four principal character strengths, each leading to one of the six higher-level virtues
  1. Wisdom: Curiosity, Love of Learning, Judgment, Ingenuity, Emotional intelligence, Perspective
  2. Courage: Valor, Perseverance, Integrity
  3. Humanity: Kindness, Loving
  4. Justice: Citizenship, Fairness, Leadership
  5. Temperance: Self-control, Prudence, Humility
  6. Transcendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, Gratitude, Hope, Spirituality, Forgiveness, Humor, Zest
- In all human cultures, the social world has two clear dimensions: a horizontal dimension of closeness or liking, and a vertical one of hierarchy or status

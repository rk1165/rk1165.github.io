### The Wisdom of Finance

- **Should** is how others want us to show up in the world  —  how we’re suppose to think, what we ought to say, what we should or shouldn’t do. It’s the vast array of expectations that others layer upon us.
- **Must** is who we are, what we believe, and what we do when we are alone with our truest, most authentic self. It’s our instincts, our cravings and longings, the things and places and ideas we burn for, the intuition that swells up from somewhere deep inside of us. Must is what happens when we stop conforming to other people’s ideals and start connecting to our own.

### The Education of a Value Investor

- The entire pursuit of value investing requires you to see where the crowd is wrong so that you can profit from their misperceptions.
- Value investing approach to life: Pick up something cheap that my one day prove to be precious
- It's very important always to live your life by an inner scorecard, not an outer scorecard.
- If you're even slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy - if you're patient.
- If we're looking to make better investment decisions, it helps immeasurably to develop a series of rules and routines that we can apply consistently.
- asking about a company - 'what needs to happen for them to generate a lot of cash next year?'
- checklist: company generates lots of cash, and it doesn't need much capital.

### The Global Minotaur

- When the entities (countries, unions, regions) have its own currency, it is the exchange rate that gradually shifts in order to absorb the strain caused by trade imbalances.
- Germany's persistent surplus vis-a-vis countries like Greece and Italy resulted in a gradual devaluation of the drachma and the Lira relative to the Deutschemark.
- Once these economic regions are bound together by the same currency something else is required to release the tension cause by unbalanced trade and capital flows - some mechanism for recycling surpluses from the surplus regions to the deficit regions.
- Such recycling might be in the shape of simple transfers (e.g paying unemployment benefits in Yorkshire through taxes raised in Sussex) Or - and this is much more desirable for both the surplus and the deficit regions - it might be in the form of productive and profitable investments in the deficit regions (e.g directing business to build factories in the north of England or Ohio)
- Without an effective surplus recycling mechanism in place, a currency union is bound to succumb to tectonic shifts, which eventually cause great cracks to form before finally the union shatters.
- How a small crisis anywhere could easily turn into another global catastrophe?
  - Once the crisis began, whether in a surplus country or not, it would inevitably soon reach a deficit nation. Even if it arrived in the form of a small downturn, some debtors would be made to feel that they were carrying too much debt. Keen to reduce their exposure, they would cut spending. But since, at the level of the national economy, society’s overall demand is the sum of private and public expenditure, when a large segment of the business community tries to reduce debt (by cutting expenditure), overall demand declines, sales drop, businesses close their doors, unemployment rises and prices fall. As prices fall, consumers decide to wait for them to fall further before buying costly items. A vicious debt–deflation cycle thus takes hold.
  - Now, since this is a deficit country, the government is more likely than not to be labouring under an already considerable budget deficit (with tax revenue less than expenditure) and a large accumulated public debt. The recession squeezes taxes, boosts the state’s deficit and forces the government to pay higher interest rates to service its increasing debts. Politicians react instinctively by cutting public spending in the midst of the recession. Thus, with both private and public expenditure falling fast, domestic demand collapses
- China's consumption-to-GDP ratio is falling - a sure sign that the domestic market cannot generate enough demand for China's gigantic factories.

### Globalization and its discontents

- If you raise interest rates to exobitant levels, firms that are highly indebted can be forced into bankruptcy.
- Fiscal policies - increasing expenditures or cutting taxes.
- exapnsionary economic policies - such as increasing expenditures, reducing taxes, or lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy
- Countries whose governments spend more than they take in taxes and foreign aid, often will face inflation, especially if they finance their deficits by printing money.
- fungibility - simply refers to the fact that money going in for one purpose frees up other money for another use.
- Liberalization - the removal of government interference in financial markets, capital markets, and barriers to trade.
- Capital market liberalization entails stripping away the regulations intended to control the flow of hot money in and out of the country - short-term loans and contracts that are usually no more than bets on exchange rate movements.
- The inflow of capital leads to an appreciation of the currency, making imports cheap and exports expensive.
- Trade liberalization _accompanied by high interest rates_ is an almost certain recipe for job destruction and unemployment creation.
- Financial market liberalization _unaccompanied by an appropriate regulatory structure_ is an almost certain recipe for economic instability - and may well lead to higher, not lower interest rates,
- Privatization, _unaccompanied by competition policies and oversight to ensure that monopoly powers are not abused_ can lead to higher, not lower, prices for consumers. Fiscal austerity, pursued _blindly_, in the wrong circumstances, can lead to high unemployment and a shredding of the social contract.
- Speculators, believing that a currency will devalue, try to move out of the currency and into dollars. The government tries to support the currency. It sells dollars from its reserves buying up the local currency, to sustain its value.
- As real estate price rise, banks feel they can lend more on the basis of the collateral; as investors see prices going up, they want to get in on the game before it's too late - and the bankers give them the money to do it. Real estate developers see quick profits by putting up new buildings, until excess capacity results. The developers can't rent their space, they default on their loans, and the bubble bursts.
- Wall Street regards inflation as the worst thing in the world : it erodes the real value of what is owed to creditors, which leads to increases in interest rates, which in turn lead to declines in bond prices.
- Large deficits can be a problem. They can be a problem because they imply a country has to borrow year after year. And if those who are providing the capital change their minds and stop making loans, the country can be in big trouble - a crisis.
- And problems are even worse if the country has borrowed short term, so that creditors can demand back _now_ what they have lent to finance previous years' deficits, whether they were used to finance consumption splurges or long-term investments.
- "solvent but not liquid" that is, which have a positive net worth, but which cannot obtain funds from elsewhere.

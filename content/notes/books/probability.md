### Risk Savvy

- In a world of known risks, everything, including the probabilities is known for certain. Here, statistical thinking and logic are sufficient to make good decisions. In an uncertain world, not everything is known, and one cannot calculate the best option. Here, good rules of thumb and intuition are also required.
- **Recognition heuristic**: If you recognize the name of one city but not that of the other, then you infer that the recognized city has the larger population.
- Whenever known risks are mistaken for certainty, the _zero-risk illusion_ occurs.
- The _calculable-risk illusion_ mistakes uncertainty for known risks. Also called _turkey-illusion_.
- Ask whether checklists are used, such as in medical diagnosis.
- **Defensive decision making**: A person or group ranks option A as the best for the situation, but chooses an inferior option B to protect itself in case something goes wrong.
- Questions to ask:
  - Don't ask your doctor what they recommend you, ask them what they would do if it were their mother, brother, or child.
  - What is the benefit of the treatment?
  - How large was the "success" among those who were not treated?
  - What precisely do you mean when you say success?
  - What are the harms of the treatment?
- Internal goals include becoming a mature person by stregthening one's skills, competences and moral values and living a meaningful life.
- People try to be part of majority, fear of loss of peer-esteem.
- In board meetings always ask if anyone is having a gut feeling.
- Hire well and let them do their jobs.
- Decentralize operations, decentralize strategy. Serves the goal of making better decisions by benefitting from local knowledge at the same time increasing responsibility by distributing it.
- Promote from within. Can help to ensure competence & adherence tp corporate values.
- Choose the alternative that avoids the worst outcome (min max rule)
- Minimizing the losses of the maximum loss scenario happens.
- People overestimate their own chance of winning (success).
- Ask the waiter: What would you eat here this evening? (In good restaurants) or imitate your peers while ordering.
- _**Satisficing**_: Buying the first something that is good enough. (in love)
- Maximizing: going through the menu / trying every pair of trousers.
- _**37 percent rule**_: N/e, N is the number of alternatives.
  1. Set your aspiration level.
  2. Choose the first alternative that meets your aspiration level and then stop searching.
- Risks can be calculated when three conditions held:
  1. **Low uncertainty**: the world is stable and predictable.
  2. **Few alternatives**: not too many risk factors have to be estimated.
  3. High amount of data available to makes these estimations.

### The Signal and the Noise

- **Unknown unknowns**: the risks that we are not even aware of.
- **Unknown knowns**: the risks we think we have a handle on, but don't.
- **Risk** is something that you can put a price on.
- **Uncertainty** on the other hand, is risk that is hard to measure.
- **Hedgehogs** are personalities who believe in Big Ideas—in governing principles about the world that behave as though they were physical laws and undergird virtually every interaction in society. Think Karl Marx and class struggle, or Sigmund Freud and the unconscious. Or Malcolm Gladwell and the “tipping point.”
- **Foxes** on the other hand, are scrappy creatures who believe in a plethora of little ideas and in taking a multitude of approaches toward a problem. They tend to be more tolerant of nuance, uncertainty, complexity, and dissenting opinion. If hedgehogs are hunters, always looking out for the big kill, then foxes are gatherers.
- Foxes are considerably better at forecasting than hedgehogs.

| How Foxes Think                            | How Hedgehogs Think              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Multidisciplinary:** Incorporate ideas from different disciplines and regardless of their origin on the political spectrum.                                  | **Specialized:** Often have spent the bulk of their careers on one or two great problems. May view the opinions of "outsiders" skepticaly.                    |
| **Adaptable:** Find a new approach—or pursue multiple approaches at the same time—if they aren’t sure the original one is working.                             | **Stalwart:** Stick to the same “all-in” approach—new data is used to refine the original model.                                                              |
| **Self-critical:** Sometimes willing (if rarely happy) to acknowledge mistakes in their predictions and accept the blame for them.                             | **Stubborn:** Mistakes are blamed on bad luck or idiosyncratic circumstances - a good model had a bad day.                                                    |
| **Tolerant of complexity:** See the universe as complicated, perhaps to the point of many fundamental problems being irresolvable or inherently unpredictable. | **Order-seeking:** Expect that the world will be found to abide by relatively simple governing relationships once the signal is identified through the noise. |
| **Cautious:** Express their predictions in probabilistic terms and qualify their opinions.                                                                     | **Confident:** Rarely hedge their predictions and are reluctant to change them.
| **Empirical:** Rely more on observation than theory.                           | **Ideological:** Expect that solutions to many day-to-day problems are manifestations of some grander theory or struggle. |

- How do you react to new information when it comes your way? Being too hot under the collar and overreacting to a change in the circumstances or being too cool to change your mind when the evidence dictates otherwise will lead to bad predictions.
- The key to making a good forecast is not in limiting yourself to quantitative information. Rather it's having a good process for weighing the information appropriately.
- The litmus test for whether you are a competent forecaster is if more information makes your predictions better.
- Good innovators typically think very big and they think very small. New ideas are sometimes found in the most granular details of a problem where few other bother to look. And they are sometimes found when you are doing your most abstract and philosophical thinking, considering why the world is the way that it is and whether there might be an alternative to the dominant paradigm.
- **Gutenberg-Richter law:** In the case of earthquakes, it turns out that for every increase of one point in magnitude, an earthquake becomes about ten times less frequent.
- The theory suggests that very simple things can behave in strange and mysterious ways when they interact with one another.
- The substantive variables fall into about a dozen major categories: growth (as measured by GDP and its components), jobs, inflation, interest rates, wages and income, consumer confidence, industrial production, sales and consumer spending, asset prices (like stocks and homes), commodity prices (like oil futures), and measures of fiscal policy and government spending.
- One of the most useful quantities for predicting disease spread is a variable called the basic reproduction number. Usually designated as *R0, it measures the number of uninfected people that can expect to catch a disease from a single infected individual*. An R0 of 4, for instance, means that — in the absence of vaccines or other preventative measures - someone who gets a disease can be expected to pass it along to four other individuals before recovering (or dying) from it.
- Successful gamblers - and successful forecasters of any kind - do not think of the future in terms of no-lose bets, unimpeachable theories, and infinitely precise measurements. These are the illusions of the sucker, the sirens of his overconfidence. Successful gamblers, instead, think of the future as speckles of probability, flickering upward and downward like a stock market ticker to every new jolt of information. When their estimates of these probabilities diverge by a sufficient margin from the odds on offer, they may place a bet.
- The most practical definition of a Bayesian prior might simply be the odds at which you are willing to place a bet. Or more properly, the odds you would set as a betting line so as to be indifferent between either side of the bet. Most Bayesians do require that priors avoid what is called a Dutch book, where the odds are incoherent. If you establish a set of prior probabilities on each of the thirty teams winning the NBA championship, they have to add up to 100 percent exactly since this represents an exhaustive set of possibilities.
- **Metacognition** - thinking about the way we think.
- Simply looking at periods when the stock market has increased at a rate much faster than its historical average can give you some inkling of a bubble.
- I pay quite a bit of attention to what the consensus view is - what a market like Intrade is saying - when I make a forecast. It is never an absolute constraint. But the further I move away from that consensus, the stronger my evidence has to be before I come to the view that I have things right and everyone else has it wrong.

### Antifragile

- Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.
- Try to understand how things react to volatility.
- Fragility and antifragility mean potential gain or harm from exposure to _something_ related to volatility. What is that something? It's membership in the extended disorder family.
- The Extended Disorder Family
  - uncertainty, variability, imperfect; incomplete knowledge, chance, chaos, volatility, disorder, entropy, time, the unknown, randomness, turmoil, stressor, error, dispersion of outcomes, unknowledge.
- Just about anything that matters can be classified into three categories - The Triad. The triad classifies items in three columns along the designation - FRAGILE, ROBUST, ANTIFRAGILE
- Mithridatization the result of an exposure to a small dose of a substance that, over time, makes one immune to additional, larger quantities of it.
- _Hormesis_ a word coined by pharmacologists, is when a small dose of a harmful substance is actually beneficial for the organism, acting as medicine.
- Sophistication is born out of hunger (_artificia docuit fames_)
- Difficulty is what makes up the genius (_ingenium mal saepe movent_)
- Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.
- Some jobs and professions are fragile to reputational harm. You don't want to "control" your reputation. Instead, focus on alerting your exposure, say, by putting yourself in a position impervious to reputational damage.
- Reinsurance companies, who focus on insuring catastrophic risks (and are used by insurance companies to "re-insure" such non-diversifiable risks)
- The more variability you observe in a system, the less Black Swan prone it is.
- Focus on getting out of the Fourth quadrant - Black Swan domain. The one in which we have a high exposure to rare, "tail" events _and_ these events are incompatible.
- You can't predict in general, but you can predict that those who rely on predictions are taking more risks, will have some trouble, perhaps even go bust.
- Success brings an asymmetry: you now have a lot more to lose than to gain.
- When you become rich, the pain of losing your fortune exceeds the emotional gain of getting addtional wealth, so you start living under continuous emotional threat.
- The modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.
- Invest in good actions. Things can be taken away from us - not good deeds and acts of virtue.
- If you have more to lose than to benefit from events of fate, there is an asymmetry, and not a good one.
- As Publilius Syrus wrote, nothing can be done both hastily and safely - almost nothing
- Antifragility is the combination _aggressiveness plus paranoia_ - clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside, the positive Black Swans, take care of itself.
- All you need is the wisdom to _not do_ unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur.
- Life is long gamma. Long gamma means "benefits from volatility and variability".
- The two distinct payoffs, with "bounded left" (limited losses, like Thales' bet) and "bounded right" (limited gains, like insurance or banking)
- Someone with a linear payoff needs to be right more than 50 percent of the time. Someone with a convex payoff much less.
- Your _function of something_ is very convex, so you can be wrong and still do fine - the more uncertainty, the better.
- If you have favorable asymmetries, or positive convexity, options being a special case, then in the long run you will do reasonably well, outperforming the average in the presence of uncertainty. The more uncertainty, the more role for optionality to kick in, and the more you will outperform. This property is very central to life.
- _apophasis_ (saying no, or mentioning without mentioning)
- I am invariably hit with the following idea. If true wealth consists in worriless sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal gratitude, absence of envy, good appetite, muscle strength, physical energy, frequent laughs, no meals alone, no gym class, some physical labor (or hobby), good bowel movements, no meeting rooms, and periodic surprises, then it is largely subtractive.

### The Black Swan

- Everybody knows that you need more prevention than treatment, but few reward acts of prevention.
- Platonicity, the desire to cut reality into crisp shapes.
- A scalable profession is good only if you are successful; they are more competitive, produce monstrous inequalities, and are far more random, with huge disparities between efforts and rewards - a few can take a large share of the pie, leaving others out entirely at no fault of their own.
- In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total.
- Almost all social matters are from Extremistan.
- We react to a piece of information not on its logical merit, but on the basis of which framework surrounds it, and how it registers with our social-emotional system.
- You formulate a (bold) conjecture and you start looking for the observation that would prove you wrong. This is the alternative to our search for confirmatory instances.
- George Soros, when making a financial bet, keeps looking for instances that would prove his initial theory wrong. This, perhaps, is true self-confidence: the ability to look at the world without the need to find signs that stroke one's ego.
- Once your mind is inhabited with a certain view of the world, you will tend to only consider instances proving you to be right. Paradoxically, the more information you have, the more justified you will feel in your views.
- There are two varities of rare events:
  - the _narrated_ Black Swans, those that are present in the current discourse and that you are likely to hear about on TV.
  - those nobody talks about, since they escape models - those that you would feel ashamed discussing in public because they do not seem plausible.
- Events that are nonrepeatable are ignored before their occurrence, and overestimated after (for a while)
- Researchers have mapped our activities into (roughly) a dual mode of thinking, which they separate as "System 1" and "System 2," or the _experiential_ and the _cogitative_.
- **System 1**, the experiential one, is effortless, automatic, fast, opaque (we do not know that we are using it), parallel-processed, and can lend itself to errors. It is what we call "intuition", and performs these quick acts of prowess that became popular under the name _blink_. System 1 is highly emotional, precisely because it is quick. It produces shortcuts, called "heuristics", that allow us to function rapidly and effectively.
- **System 2**, the cogitative one, is what we normally call _thinking_. It is what you use in a classroom, as it is effortful, reasoned, slow, logical, serial, progressive, and self-aware.
- Most of our mistakes in reasoning come from using System 1 when we are in fact thinking that we are using System 2.
- Our intuitions are not cut out for nonlinearities. Our emotional apparatus is designed for linear causality.
- As a matter of fact, your happiness depends far more on the number of instances of positive feelings, what psychologists call "positive affect", than on their intensity when they hit. So to have a pleasant life you should spread these small "affects" across time as evenly as possible.
- It is much easier to sell "Look what I did for you" than "Look what I avoided for you"
- The difference between what people actually know and how much they think they know.
- Prediction requires knowing about technologies that will be discovered in the future. But that very knowledge would almost automatically allow us to start developing those technologies right away. Ergo, we do not know what we will know.
- You need to love to lose.
- Make a distinction between positive contingencies and negative ones. Learn to distinguish between those human undertakings in which the lack of predictability can be (or has been) extremely beneficial and those where the failure to understand the future caused harm.
- Aside from the movies, examples of positive-Black Swan businesses are some segments of publishing, scientific research, and venture capital. In these businesses, you lose small to make big.
- Don't look for the precised and the local. Simply, do not be narrow-minded. Invest in preparedness, not in prediction.
- Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity.
- We can have a clear idea of the consequences of an event, even if we do not know how likely it is to occur.
- This idea that in order to make a decision you need to focus on the consequences (which you can know) rather than the probability (which you can't know) is the _central idea of uncertainty_
- You can build an overall theory of decision making on this idea. All you have to do is mitigate the consequences.
- We can make good use of the Gaussian approach in variables for which there is a rational reason for the largest not to be too far away from the average.
- If you are dealing with qualitative inference, such as in psychology or medicine, looking for yes/no answers to which magnitudes don't apply, then you can assume you're in Mediocristan without serious problems.
- If you are dealing with aggregates, where magnitudes do matter, such as income, your wealth, return on a portfolio, or book sales, then you will have a problem and get the wrong distribution if you use the Gaussian, as it does not belong there.
- I try to worry about matters I can do something about.
- I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans - when a failure would be of small moment- and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan.
- Not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that's what you are seeking.
- You stand above the rate race and the pecking order, not _outside_ of it, of you do so by choice.
- You have far more control over your life if you decide on your criterion by yourself.
- Felix qui nihil debet : "Happy is he who owes nothing."
- In an ergodic system, the probabilities of what may happen in the long run are not impacted by events that may take place, say, next year.
- A nonergodic system has no real long-term properties - it is prone to path dependency.
- A complex domain is characterized by the following : there is a great degree of interdependence between its elements, both temporal (a variable depends on its past changes), horizontal (variables depend on one another), and diagonal (variable A depends on the past history of variable B)
- It is much more sound to take risks you can measure than to measure the risks you are taking.
- People do not realize that success consists mainly in avoiding losses, not in trying to derive profits.
- The following rules of "wisdom" to increase robustness
  - Have respect for time and nondemonstrative knowledge.
  - Avoid optimization; learn to love redundancy.
  - Avoid prediction of small-probability payoffs - though not necessarily of ordinary ones.
  - Beware the "atypicality" of remote events.
  - Beware moral hazard with bonus payments
  - Avoid some risk metrics
  - Positive or negative Black Swan?
  - Do not confuse absence of volatility with absence of risk
  - Beware presentations of risk numbers
- I separated the "idea" person who sells an intellectual product in the form of a transaction or a piece of work, from the "labour" person, who sells you his work.
- It takes considerable effort to see facts (and remember them) while witholding judgment and resisting explanation
- Some business bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and _if you have the personal and intellectual stamina_
- Judgements are embedded in the way we view objects. I do not see a "tree", I see a pleasant or an ugly tree.

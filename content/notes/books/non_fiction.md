### The Talent Code

- Every human skill, whether it’s playing baseball or playing Bach, is created by chains of nerve fibres carrying a tiny electrical impulse – basically, a signal traveling through a circuit. Myelin’s vital role is to wrap those nerve fibres the same way that rubber insulation wraps a copper wire, making the signal stronger and faster by preventing the electrical impulses leaking out.
- Deep practice is built on a paradox: struggling in certain targeted ways - operating at the edges of your ability, where you make mistakes - makes you smarter. Or to put it a slightly different way, experiences where you’re forced to slow down, make errors, and correct them-as you would if you were walking up an ice-covered hill, slipping and stumbling as you go-ends up making you swift and graceful without realizing it.
- The trick is to choose a goal just beyond your present abilities: to target the struggle.
- Genes construct our brains so that when we encounter certain stimuli – a tasty meal, rotting meat, a stalking tiger, or a potential mate – a factory-loaded neural program kicks into gear, using emotions to guide our behaviour in a useful direction. We feel hunger when we smell a meal, disgust when we smell rotten meat, fear when we see a tiger, desire when we see a potential mate. Guided by these preset neural programs, we navigate toward a solution.
- Skill consists of identifying important elements and grouping them into a meaningful framework. The name psychologists use for such organization is chunking.
- Talent requires deep practice; deep practice requires vast amounts of energy; primal cues trigger huge outpourings of energy.
- Laws of learning: explanation, demonstration, imitation, correction and repetition.
- Don’t look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens – and when it happens, it lasts.

### A Whole New Mind

- Aptitudes on which professional and personal satisfaction increasingly will depend. Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, Meaning
- The left hemisphere (of brain) is sequential, logical, and analytical. The right hemisphere is nonlinear, intuitive, and holistic.
- The left hemisphere handles what is said; the right hemisphere focuses on how it’s said – the nonverbal, often emotional cues delivered through gaze, facial expression, and intonation.
- The left hemisphere analyses the details; the right hemisphere synthesizes the big picture.
- Amygdalas play a crucial role in processing emotions, especially fear.
- Right hemisphere is specialized both for recognizing faces and for interpreting expressions.
- L-Directed thinking – sequential, literal, functional, textual, and analytic.
- R-Directed thinking – simultaneous, metaphorical, aesthetic, contextual, and synthetic.
- Lawyers, doctors, accountants, engineers, and executives are called knowledge workers.
- Symphony is the ability to put together the pieces. It is the capacity to synthesize rather than to analyze; to see relationships between seemingly unrelated fields; to detect broad patterns rather than to deliver specific answers; and to invent something new by combining elements nobody else thought to pair.
- Sometimes the most powerful ideas come from simply combining two existing ideas nobody else ever thought to unite.
- The key to success is to risk thinking unconventional thoughts. Convention is the enemy of progress. As longs as you’ve got slightly more perception than the average wrapped loaf, you could invent something.
- Ability to perceive one’s own life in a way that encompasses the full spectrum of human possibility is essential to the search for meaning.

### The Five Elements of Effective Thinking

- The root of success in everything, from academics to business to leadership to personal relationships and everything else, is thinking — whether it’s thinking disguised as intuition or as good values or as decision making or problem solving or creativity, it’s all thinking.
- Understand deeply:
- Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know
  - Make mistakes
  - Raise questions
  - Follow the flow of ideas
- To learn any subject well and to create ideas beyond those that have existed before, return to the basics repeatedly.
- Great scientists, creative thinkers, and problem solvers do not solve hard problems head-on. When they are faced with a daunting question, they immediately and prudently admit defeat.
- When faced with a difficult issue or challenge, do something else. Focus entirely on solving a subproblem that you know you can successfully resolve.
- When faced with an issue that is complicated and multifaceted, attempt to isolate the essential ingredients
- The strategy of clearing the clutter and seeking the essential involves two steps:
  1. Identify and ignore all distracting features to isolate the essential core
  2. Analyze that central issue and apply those insights to the larger whole.
- Whenever you "see" an issue or "understand" a concept, be conscious of the lens through which you’re viewing the subject. You should assume you’re introducing bias.
- To better understand your world, consciously acknowledge what you actually see — no matter how mundane or obvious — rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see.
- Regularly consider your opinions, beliefs, and knowledge, and subject them to the "How do I know?" test. What is the evidence that your understanding is based upon? Become aware of the sources of your opinions.
- Forcing yourself to see what’s actually in front of you rather than what you believe you should see is a difficult task
- If you want to get more out of what you hear or see, force yourself to ask questions
- Effective questions turn your mind in directions that lead to new insights and solutions.
- To generate new ideas through flow, first modify an existing idea within its own context and then apply that same idea in different settings. Then you can construct extensions, refinements, and variations.
- Being wrong allows you to better realize what is truly there, and offers insights as to how the ideas might actually fit together.

### Originals

- Put a lot of ideas out there and see which ones are praised and adopted by your target audience.
- In the face of uncertainty, our first instinct is often to reject novelty, looking for reasons why unfamiliar concepts might fail.
- Personality trait most associated with an interest in arts is called openness.
- To accurately predict the success of a novel idea, it is best to be a creator in the domain you're judging.
- An invention needs to be new - but it also has to be practical.
- Focus on facts, make cold judgements about the viability of the business. - (analytical investors)
- It's never the idea, it's always the execution which determines success of a start-up.
- Idiosyncrasy credits - the latitude to deviate from the group's expectations. It accrues through respect.
- Start with the limitation of an idea in a venture funding pitch - only holds if you have a persuasive message to deliver.
- The easier it is to think of something the more common and important we assume it is.
- **Exposure effect** - the more often we encounter something, the more we like it.
- Four options for holding a dissatisfying situation.
  1. Exit
  2. Voice
  3. Persistence
  4. Neglect
- 3 out of four start-ups failed because of premature scaling – making investment that the market isn't ready to support.
- When the market is uncertain, unknown or underdeveloped, being a pioneer has pronounced disadvantages.
- There are two styles of innovation - Conceptual and Experimental
- Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.
- Experimental innovators solve problems through trial & error, learning and evolving as they go along.
- If we communicate the vision behind our ideas, the purpose guiding our products, people will flock to us.
- **Groupthink** – the tendency to seek consensus instead of fostering dissent.
- **Strategic optimism** - anticipates the best, staying calm and setting high expectations.
- **Defensive pessimism** - expects the worst, feeling anxious and imagining all the things that can go wrong.
- When we're not yet committed to a particular action thinking like a defensive pessimist can be hazardous.
- When we’re experiencing doubts on the way toward achieving a goal, whether we ought to look backward or forward depends on our commitment. When our commitment is wavering, the best way to stay on track is to consider the progress we’ve already made. As we recognize what we’ve invested and attained, it seems like a waste to give up, and our confidence and commitment surge
- Once commitment is fortified, instead of glancing in the rearview mirror, it’s better to look forward by highlighting the work left to be done. When we’re determined to reach an objective, it’s the gap between where we are and where we aspire to be that lights a fire under us.

### Outliers

- Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good.
- Practical intelligence includes things like "knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect."
- It’s knowledge that helps you read situations correctly and get what you want.
- Concerted cultivation : It’s an attempt to actively "foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions and skills." Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of "accomplishment of natural growth." They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own.
- Autonomy, complexity (engaging both mind and imagination), and a connection between effort and reward—are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying.
- Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig.
- If you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind and imagination, you can shape the world to your desires.
- Success is not a random act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities
- Ask an Asian child to add three-tens-seven and two-tens-two, and then the necessary equation is right there, embedded in the sentence. No number translation is necessary: It’s five-tens-nine
- Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds.
- Outliers are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.

### David and Goliath

- **Relative Deprivation:** we form our impressions not globally, by placing ourselves in the broadest possible context, but locally — by comparing ourselves to people "in the same boat as ourselves." Our sense of how deprived we are is relative
- To be a Big fish in a little pond
- **Capitalization learning:** we get good at something by building on the strengths that we are naturally given.
- What is learned out of necessity is inevitably more powerful than the learning that comes easily
- Psychologists measure personality through what is called the Five Factor Model, or "Big Five" inventory, which assesses who we are across the following dimensions.
- **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous versus secure/confident)
- **Extraversion** (energetic/gregarious versus solitary/reserved)
- **Openness** (inventive/curious versus consistent/cautious)
- **Conscientiousness** (orderly/industrious versus easygoing/careless)
- **Agreeableness** (cooperative/empathic versus self-interested/antagonistic)

### The Power of Habit

- The process in which brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine – is known as "chunking", and it’s at the root of how habits form.
- The craving, it turns out is what makes cues and rewards work. The Craving is what powers the habit loop.
- First find a simple cue. Second clearly define the rewards
- As we associate cues with certain rewards, a subconscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spinning.
- This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.
- Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.
- Asking patients to describe what triggers their habitual behaviour is called awareness training.
- When people join groups where change seems possible, the potential for that change to occur becomes more real.
- Studies have documented that families who habitually eat dinner together seem to raise children with better homework skills, higher grades, greater emotional control and more confidence.
- Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.
- If you tell people that they have what it takes to succeed, they’ll prove you right.
- For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling.

### The Art of Thinking Clearly

- **Survivorship Bias** It means people systematically overestimate their chances of success. For instance, behind every successful company, investments, writers there are troves of failures.
- **Swimmer's Body Illusion** Whenever we confuse selection factors with results, we fall prey to the swimmer's body illusion. For example, people who are happy, are happy by nature and so they see positive in everything. It's not the other way around i.e since they see positive in everything they are happy.
- **Clustering Illusion** When it comes to pattern recognition, we are oversensitive. We might think that we may have detected a pattern, but that could be by pure chance.
- **Social Proof** Sometimes termed the "herd instinct", dictates that individuals feel they are behaving correctly when they act the same as other people. In other words, the more people who follow a certain idea, the better (truer) we deem the idea to be.
- **Sunk cost fallacy** When we have invested a lot of time, money, energy, or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry on, even if we are dealing with lost cause.
- **Reciprocity** When someone offers something for free, accepting it creates an obligation in our mind. We feel like we owe the person.
- **Confirmation bias** It is the tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing theories, beliefs, and convictions. To fight against it, try writing down your beliefs - whether in terms of worldview, investments, marriage, health care, diet, career strategies - and set out to find disconfirming evidence.
- **Authority bias** When someone in authority orders us to do something, we do without raising any questions out of sheer obedience to authority.
- **Contrast effect** We judge something to be beautiful, expensive, or large if we have something ugly, cheap, or small in front of us. We have difficulty with absoulute judgements.
- **Availability bias** We create a picture of the world using the examples that most easily come to mind. We prefer wrong information to no information.
- **It'll-get-worse-before-it-gets-better fallacy**
- **Hindsight bias** Also called the "I told you so" phenomenon. In retrospect everything seems clear and inevitable. Keep a journal. Write down your predictions - for political changes, your career, your weight, the stock market, and so on.
- **Overconfidence effect** we systematically overestimate our knowledge and our ability to predict - on a massive scale.
- **Illusion of control** The tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absoulutely no sway.
- We see people as pleasant, if (a) they are outwardly attractive, (b) they are similar to us in terms of origin, personality, or interests, and (c) they like us.
- If you want to convince someone about something, don't focus on the advantages; instead highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantages.
- **incentive super-response tendency** people respond to incentives by doing what is in their best interests.
- **Regression to mean** things tend to move back to average such as a down stock after some times moves toward its mean
- **Outcome Bias** We tend to evaluate decisions based on the result rather than on the decision process. Also known as "historian error".
- **Paradox of Choice** Less is more.
- **Liking bias** The more we like someone, the more inclined we are to buy from or help that person.
- **Endowment effect** We consider things to be more valuable the moment we own them. If we are selling something, we charge more for it than what we ourselves would be willing to spend. Don't cling to things.
- **Groupthink** This is where a group of smart people makes reckless decisions because everyone aligns their opinions with the supposed consensus.
- **Neglect of probability** We respond to the expected _magnitude_ of an event (the size of the jackpot), but not to its _likelihood_.
- **Scarcity error** in psychology is called "reactance": when we are deprived of an option, we suddenly deem it more attractive.
- **base-rate neglect** a disregard of fundamental distribution levels.
- **anchors** the boss started by saying we did this work for your competitor for 5 million dollars. The negotiations start from there. The client was anchored
- **inductive thinking** the inclination to draw universal certainities from individual observations.
- **loss aversion** How much someone (a client) is losing without our service rather than how much he will save.
- **social loafing effect** it occurs when individual performance is not directly visible it blends into the group effort.
- **fundamental attribution error** This describes the tendency to overestimate individuals' influence and underestimate external, situational factors.
- **halo effect** it occurs when a single aspect dazzles us and affects how we see the full picture.
- **Alternative paths** are all the outcomes that could have happened but did not.
- **framing** If a message is communicated in different ways, it will also be received in different ways. We react differently to identical situations, depending on how they are presented.
- **omission bias** It crops up where both action and inaction lead to cruel consequences.
- **self-serving bias** we attribute success to ourselves and failures to external factors. ask for honest opinion about your strengths and weaknesses.
- **affective forecasting** our inability to forecast our own emotions.
- **hedonic treadmill** We work hard, advance, and are able to afford more and nicer things, and yet this doesn’t make us any happier
- **association bias** the tendency to see connections where none exists.
- **hyperbolic discounting** Put plainly: The closer a reward is, the higher our "emotional interest rate" rises and the more we are willing to give up in exchange for it.
- **motivation crowding** When people do something for well-meaning, non-monetary reasons — out of the goodness of their hearts, so to speak. Payments throw a wrench into the works. Financial reward erodes any other motivations.
- **information bias** the delusion that more information guarantees better decisions.
- **effort justification** When you put a lot of energy into a task, you tend to overvalue the result.
- When expectations are fueled in the run-up to an announcement, any disparity gives rise to draconian punishment, regardless of how paltry the gap is.
- **affect heuristic** An affect is a momentary judgment: something you like or dislike. The word "gunfire" triggers a negative effect. The word "luxury" produces a positive one. This automatic, one-dimensional impulse prevents you from considering risks and benefits to be independent variables, which indeed they are. Instead, the affect heuristic puts risks and benefits on the same sensory thread.
- **introspection illusion** The belief that reflection leads to truth or accuracy.
- **alternative blindness** We systematically forget to compare an existing offer with the next-best alternative.
- **social comparison bias** The tendency to withhold assistance to people who might outdo you, even if you look like a fool in the long run.
- **recency effect** or **primacy effect** The first trait outshine the rest. The more recent the information, the better we remember it.
- **false-consensus effect** We frequently overestimate unanimity with others, believing that everyone else thinks and feels exactly like we do.
- **illusion of attention** We are confident that we notice everything that takes place in front of us. But in reality, we often see only what we are focusing on
- Negative knowledge (what _not_ to do) is much more potent than positive knowledge (what to do)

### Algorithms to Live By

- _**Optimal Stopping – When to stop looking**_
- In any optimal stopping problem, the crucial dilemma is not which option to pick, but how many options to even consider.
- **Look-Then-Leap Rule:** You set a predetermined amount of time for "looking" - that is, exploring your options, gathering data – in which you categorically don't choose anyone, no matter how impressive. After that point, you enter the "leap" phase, prepared to instantly commit to anyone who outshines the best applicant you saw in the look phase. 37% Rule: look at the first 37% of the applicants, choosing none, then be ready to leap for anyone better than all those you've seen so far.
- The bigger the applicant pool gets, the more valuable knowing the optimal algorithm becomes.
- This rule can be applied to either the number of applicants or the time over which one is searching.
- Trying to make the best choice when options only present themselves one by one is also the basic structure of selling a house, parking a car, and quitting when you're ahead.
- _**Explore/Exploit - The Latest vs. The Greatest**_
- Do we try new things or stick with our favorite ones?
- Exploration is gathering information, and exploitation is using the information you have to get a known good result.
- People tend to treat decisions in isolation, to focus on finding each time the outcome with the highest expected value. But decisions are almost never isolated, and expected value isn't the end of the story.
- Explore when you will have time to use the resulting knowledge, exploit when you're ready to cash in. The interval makes the strategy
- **Win-Stay, Lose-Shift algorithm**: choose an arm at random, and keep pulling it as long as it keeps paying off.
- Sometimes the trick is essentially to work backward, starting by imagining the final pull and considering which slot machine to choose given all the possible outcomes of the previous decisions.
- multiple options to pursue, a different probability of reward for each option, and a certain amount of effort (or money, or time) to be allocated among them.
- **Upper Confidence Bound** algorithm says, quite simply, to pick the option for which the top of the confidence interval is highest.
- Some problems are better avoided than solved
- Gittins index
- Regret minimization
- Shortest processing rime : minimize the sum of completion times, always do the quickest task you can
- Constraint relaxation
- Lagrangian relaxation
- Hill climbing
- Simulated annealing
- Exponential backoff
- AIMD- additive increase, multiplicative decrease

### The Drunkard's Walk

- According to Benford's law, rather than all nine digits' appearing with equal frequency, the number 1 should appear as the first digit in data about 30 percent of the time; the digit 2, about 18 percent of the time; and so on, down to the digit 9, which should appear as the first digit about 5 percent of the time.
- Many types of data obey Benford's law, in particular, financial data.
- In fact, the law seems tailor-made for mining large amounts of financial data in search of fraud.
- It is important to know the false positive rate when assessing any diagnostic test.
- Pearson invented a method, called the chi-square test, by which you can determine whether a set of data actually conforms to the distribution you believe it conforms to.
- This is what significance testing does: it is a formal procedure for calculating the probability of our having observed what we observed _if_ the hypothesis we are testing is true. If the probability is low, we reject the hypothesis. If it is high, we accept it.

### Prisoners of Geograpy

- When faced with what is considered an existential threat, a great power will use force
- There are various branches of Sunni Islam that follow particular great scholars from the past, including the strict Hanbali tradition, named after the ninth-century Iraqi scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal, favoured by many Sunnis from Qatar and Saudi Arabia; this in turn has influenced the ultra-puritanical Salafi thought, which predominates among jihadists.
- Shia Islam has three main divisions, the best known of which is probably the Twelvers, who adhere to the teaching of the Twelve Imams, but even that contains divisions. The Ismaili school disputes the lineage of the seventh Imam, while the Zaidi school disputes that of the fifth Imam. There are also several offshoots from mainstream Shia Islam, with the Alawites (Alawis) and Druze being considered so far away from traditional Islamic thought that many other Muslims, especially among the Sunni, do not even recognise them as being part of the religion.
- The four main schools of Islamic jurisprudence—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafei, and Hanbali

### Superforecasting

- Bill Gates wrote: "You can achieve incredible progress if you set a clear goal and find a measure that will drive progress toward that goal... This may seem basic, but it is amazing how often it is not done and how hard it is to get right.
- The fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing. Foxes beat hedgehogs
- A smart executive will not expect universal agreement, and will treat its appearance as a warning flag that groupthink has taken hold.
- An awareness of irreducible uncertainty is the core of probabilistic thinkning.
- Philosophers distinguish between **Epistemic** and **Aleatory** uncertainty.
- _Epistemic_ uncertainty is something you don't know but is, at least in theory, knowable.
- _Aleatory_ uncertainty is something you not only don't know; it's unknowable. Aleatory uncertainty ensures life will always have surprises, regardless of how carefully we plan.
- Meaning is a basic human need. As much research shows, the ability to find it is a marker of a healthy, resilient mind.
- Counterfactual thinking, which is thinking about how something might have turned out differently than it actually did.
- A probabilistic thinker will be less distracted by "why" questions and focus on "how".
- You tend to believe that history played out in a logical sort of sense, that people ought to have foreseen, but it's not like that. It's an illusion of hindsight.
- There are two dangers a forecaster faces after making the initial call. One is not giving enough weight to new information. That's _underreaction_. The other danger is overreacting to new information, seeing it as more meaningful than it is, and adjusting a forecast too radically.
- To learn from failure, we must _know_ when we fail.
- Grit is passionate perseverance of long term goals, even in the face of frustration and failure.
- A program that is not intended to be released in a final version but will instead be used, analyzed, and improved without end. It is **perpetual beta**

- Groups that get along too well don't question assumptions or confront uncomfortable facts.
- _Aufstragstaktik_ "Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity". i.e don't tell them how to do it.
- Ten commandments for aspiring superforecasters:
  - Focus on questions where your hard work is likely to pay off.
  - Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems
  - Strike the right balance between inside and outside views. How often do things of this sort happen in situations of this sort?
  - Strike the right balance between under and overreacting to evidence
  - Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. For every good policy argument, there is typically a counterargument that is at least worth acknowledging.
  - Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.
  - Strike the right balance between under and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness. Superforecasters understand the risks both of rushing to judgement and of dawdling too long near "maybe"
  - Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases.
  - Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you. Master the fine arts of _perspective taking_ (understanding the arguments of the other side so well that you can reproduce them to the other's satisfaction), _precision questioning_ (helping others to clarify their arguments so they are not misunderstood) and _constructive confrontation_ (learning to disagree without being disagreeable)
  - Master the error-balancing bicycle

### Sapiens

- An **objective** phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs. Radioactivity.
- The **subjective** is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual.
- The **inter-subjective** is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear.
- Dualism states there is one good god and one evil god. There is a cosmic battle between the two. Dualist religions Gnosticism and Manichaeanism.
- Gautama's insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatisfied and restless.
- A person who doesn't crave cannot suffer.
- The generally accepted definition of happiness is "subjective well-being". Happiness, according to this view, is something I feel inside myself, a sense of either immediate pleasure or long-term contentment with the way my life is going.
- The key to happiness is to know the truth about yourself - to understand who, or what, you really are. Most people wrongly identify themselves with their feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes.

### Skin in the Game

- _Lex talionis_ - an eye for an eye
- Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk.
- People who are not morally independent tend to fit ethics to their profession (with a minimum of spinning), rather than find a profession that fits their ethics.
- _Compendiaria res improbitas, virtusque tarda_ — the villainous takes the short road, virtue the longer one
- Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is "good for you" while it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him.
- What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing
- The more you have to lose the more fragile you are
- Burn old logs. Drink old wine. Read old books. Keep old friends
- Simply, we waste more than a third of our food supply, and the gains from simple improvement in distribution would far outweigh those from modification of supply. Simply consider that close to 80 or 85 percent of the cost of a tomato can be attributed to transportation, storage, and waste (unsold inventories), rather than the cost at the farmer level
- You start betting aggressively whenever you have a profit, never when you have a deficit, as if a switch was turned on or off. This method is practiced by probably every single trader who has survived.

### The Culture Map

- The eight scale model
  - _Communicating_ : low-context vs high-context
  - _Evaluating_ : direct negative feedback vs. indirect negative feedback
  - _Persuading_ : principles-first vs. applications-first
  - _Leading_ : egalitarian vs. hierarchical
  - _Deciding_ : consensual vs. top-down
  - _Trusting_ : task-based vs. relationship-based
  - _Disagreeing_ : confrontational vs. avoids confrontation
  - _Scheduling_ : linear-time vs. flexible time
- Scheduling scale reflects how people in various cultures tend to manage time.
- Trusing scale positions cultures according to whether they build trust based on relationships or on experience of shared tasks
- Low-context communication - people from such cultures are conditioned from childhood to assume a low level of shared context - that is, few shared reference points and comparatively little implicit knowledge linking speaker and listener.
- For verification, ask open-ended questions rather than backing the person into a corner that requires a yes or no response.
- Multicultural teams need low-context processes.
- _upgraders_ - words preceding or following negative feedback that make it feel stronger, such as _absolutely_, _totally_, or _strongly_
- _downgraders_ - words that soften the criticism, such as _kind of_, _sort of_, _a little_, _a bit_, _maybe_, and _slightly_
- When providing an evaluation, be _explicit_ and _low-context_ with both positive and negative feedback
- The positive comments should be honest and stated in a detailed, explicit manner.
- Be balanced in the amount of positive and negative feedback you give.
- Frame your behaviour in cultural terms.
- In high-context communication :
  - give the feedback slowly, over a period of time, so that it gradually sinks in.
  - use food and drink to blur an unpleasant message
- In Germany, we try to understand the theoretical concept before adapting it to the practical situation.
- _Principles-first reasoning_ (sometimes referred to as _deductive reasoning_) derives conclusions or facts from general principles or concepts.
- _Applications-first reasoning_ (sometimes called _inductive reasoning_) - general conclusions are reached based on a pattern of factual observations from the real world.
- US, UK, Aus, Canada, and NZ tend to fall to the far right on the Persuading scale where applications-first cultures are clustered
- France, Russia, and Belgium appear on the principles-first side of the scale.
- Presenting to Londoners or New Yorkers? Get to the points and stick to it. Presenting to French, Spaniards, or Germans? Spend more time setting the parameters and explaining the background before jumping to your conclusion.
- In _holistic_ cultures if you need to motivate, manage, or persuade someone, you will be more influential if you take the time to explain the big picture and show how all the pieces fit together.
- Power distance as "the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations accept and expect that power is distributed unequally"
- egalitarian <-> low power distance, hierarchical <-> high power distance
- If you are working with people from hierarchical society:
  - Communicate with the person at your level.
  - If you do e-mail someone at a lower hierarchical level than your own, copy the boss.
- German culture places a higher value of building consensus as part of the decision-making process, while in the US, decision making is largely invested in the individual
- _Cognitive trust_ is based on the confidence you feel in another person's accomplishments, skills, reliability. This is trust that comes from the head. It is often built through business interactions.
- _Affective trust_ arises from feelings of emotional closeness, empathy, or friendship. This type of trust comes from the heart.

### The Emperor of All maladies

- Leukemia is cancer of white blood cells.
- malignant white cells - _blasts_
- Cancer is a disease caused by the uncontrolled growth of a single cell. This growth is unleashed by mutations - changes in DNA that specifically affect genes that incite unlimited cell growth. In a normal cell, powerful genetic circuits regulate cell division and cell death. In a cancer cell, these circuits have been broken, unleashing a cell that cannot stop growing.
- genomes : the genes that unmoor normal cell division are not foreign to our bodies, but rather mutated, distorted versions of the very genes that perform vital cellular functions.
- Cells only arise from other cells thus giving only two reasons for human growth : either by increasing cell numbers or by increasing cell size. Virchow called these two modes _hyperplasia_ and _hypertrophy_
- In hypertrophy, the _number_ of cells did not change; instead, each individual cell merely grew in size.
- Hyperplasia was growth by virtue of cells incresaing in _number_
- Cancer was a disease of pathological hyperplasia in which cells acquired an autonomous will to divide. This aberrant, uncontrolled cell division created masses of tissue (tumors) that invaded organs and destroyed normal tissues. These tumors could also spread from one site to another, causing outcroppings of the disease - called metastases - in distant sites, such as the bones, the brain, or the lungs.
- Normal white cells in the blood can be broadly divided into two types of cells - myeloid cells or lymphoid cells. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was a cancer of myeloid cells. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was cancer of immature lymphoid cells. (Cancers of more mature lymphoid cells are called lymphomas)
- In ALL, as in some other cancers, the overproduction of cancer cells is combined with a mysterious arrest in the normal maturation of cells.
- White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow.
- Although superficially amorphous, bone marrow is a highly organized tissue - an organ, in truth - that generates blood in adults.
- Spleen is a fist-size organ that stores and makes blood
- The tuberculosis bacillus gradually hollows out the lung
- In inflammatory breast cancer, malignant cells invade the lymph glands of the breast, causing a red, swollen mass.
- glioblastomas - tumors so heavily crisscrossed with blood vessels that they could hemorrhage any minute, and meningiomas wrapped like sheaths around delicate and vital structures in the brain.
- Specificity refers to the ability of any medicine to discriminate between its intended target and its host.
- Choriocarcinoma - a cancer of the placenta
- Choriocarcinoma cells secrete a market, a hormone called choriogonadotropin, a protein that can be measured with an extremely sensitive test in the blood (a variant of this test is used to test pregnancies)
- Rapidly growing cells, such as those of leukemia, typically create a skeletal scaffold of proteins (called microtubules) that allows two daughter cells to separate from each other and thereby complete cell division.
- The name had many intended and unintended resonances. _Vamp_ is a word that means to improvise or patch up, to cobble something together from bits and pieces that might crumble apart any second. It can mean a seductress - one who promises but doesn't deliver. It also refers to the front of a boot, the part that carries the full brunt of force during a kick.
- The brain and spinal cord are insulated by a tight cellular seal called the blood-brain barrier that prevents foreign chemicals from easily getting into the brain. It is an ancient biological system that has evolved to keep poisons from reaching the brain.
- Large masses located in the anterior chest, as medical students learn, come in four _Ts_, thyroid cancer, thymoma, teratoma, and terrible lymphoma.
- **sarcoma** - a cancer of the connective tissues, with sheet upon sheet of rhomboid, fox-eyed cells invading the tendons and muscle.
- Hormones typically work by binding to a receptor in a target cell.
- receptor - the molecule responsibile for binding estrogen and relaying its signal to the cell.
- breast cancer cases could be neatly divided into two types - ones with cancer cells that expressed high levels of this receptor and those that expressed low levels, "ER-positive" and "ER-negative" tumors
- five-year survival rate is a measure of the fraction of patient diagnosed with a particular kind of cancer who are alive at five years after diagnosis.
- Carcinogens had a common distinctive functional property : they altered genes.
- Stomach inflammation, gastritis, a condition known to predispose patients to peptic ulcers and to stomach cancer.
- Bone marrow could be harvested from one patient and transplanted back - either into the same patient (called **autologous** transplantation) or into another patient (**allorgeneic** transplantation)
- RNA virus that could convert its genes into DNA and lodge into the human genome - retrovirus
- Inlammation makes cells divide in response to injury, but this cell division is driven as a reaction to an external agent such as a bacteria or a wound.
- Chromosomes were duplicated during cell division and divided equally between the two daughter cells.
- Functionally, a gene was a unit of inheritance that carried a biological trait from one cell to another or from one generation to the next.
- genes carried instructions to build proteins
- the genesis of proteins from genes requires an intermediary step - a molecule called RNA. It is through RNA that a gene is translated into protein.
- How genetic information is transmitted from a cell to its progeny :
  - First, genes, located in chromosomes are duplicated when a cell divides and are transmitted into progeny cells.
  - Next, a gene, in the form of DNA, is converted into its RNA copy.
  - Finally, this RNA message is translated into a protein.
- a precursor of a cancer-causing gene - the **proto-oncogene** was a normal cellular gene. Mutations induced by chemicals or X-rays caused cancer not by "inserting" foreign genes into cells, but by activating such _endogenous_ proto-oncogenes
- translocation - the flip-flot transposition of two pieces of chromosomes
- An oncogene, when mutated, provides an "on" signal for the cells to grow. A tumor suppressor gene when mutated, in contrast, removes an "off" signal for growth.
- Cancer gene mutations could succinctly be described in two categories : either activations of proto-oncogenes or inactivations of tumor suppressor genes.
- Genes encode proteins, and proteins often work like minuscule molecular switches, activating yet other proteins and inactivating others, turning molecular switches "on" and "off" inside a cell.
- Umbilical blood contains one of the richest known sources of blood-forming stem cells - cells that can be stored away in cryobanks and used for bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia in the future, an intensely precious resource.
- The twenty-four drugs have been shown to be effective against lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias. Some, such as **dasatinib**, directly inactivate oncogenes. Others target oncogene-activated pathways.
- The drug **Avastin** interrupts tumor angiogenesis by attacking the capacity of cancer cells to incite blood-vessel growth. **Bortezomib** , or **Velcade**, blocks an internal waste-dispensing mechanism for proteins.
- multiple myeloma, a cancer of immune-system cells.
- Over a decade, three novel targeted therapies have emerged for myeloma - Velcade, thalidomide, and Revlimid - all of which interrupt activated pathways in myeloma cells.
- BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes vastly increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
- The humman embryo and many of our adult organs possess a tiny population of stem cells that are capable of immortal regeneration.
- The entirety of human blood, for instance, can arise from a single, highly potent blood-forming stem cell (called a hematopoietic stem cell), which typically lives buried inside the bone marrow

### The Gene

- A genotype is an oragnism's genetic composition. It can refer to one gene, a configuration of genes, or even an entire genome.
- A phenotype, in contrast, refers to an organism's physical or biological attributes and characteristics - the color of an eye, the shape of a wing, or resistance to hot or cold temperature.
- genotype + environment + _triggers_ + _chance_ = phenotype
- Geographic isoloation leads to genetic isolation, and to eventual reproductive isolation - drove the origin of new species.
- **Chromatin** - the biological structure where genes resided - was known to be made of two types of chemicals: **proteins** and **nucleic acids**.

### Israel - A CONCISE HISTORY of a NATION REBORN

- Pogroms - attacks on Jews in Russia. Much of it was fueled by theological claims or the accusation that the Jews had killed Jesus.
- Between 1882 and 1914, some 2.5 million Jews departed eastern Europe, primarily from Austria, Poland, and Romania.

- Jewish Enlightenment (the _haskalah_)

- The books of Genesis (the first of the five Books of Moses, collectively called the Torah)
- The Israelites' first king, Saul, was deeply flawed, and the young David soon replaced him.
- David passed the kingdom on to his son, Solomon, who built the First Temple in Jerusalem in the tenth century BCE.
- The temple was situated on The Temple Mount.
- In 928 BCE the monarchy disintegrated into two often-quarrelling states: a kingdom in the north, the Kingdom of Israel (composed of ten of the twelve Israelite tribes), and a kingdom in the south, Judea (composed of two of the twelve tribes)
- In 164 BCE, a small band of Jews known as the _Maccabees_ initiated a successful revolt against the Greeks. The Maccabees managed to create the first autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel in more than 400 years, and Jews would forever celebrate that success through the holiday of Hanukkah.
- A small group, this time known as the Zealots, advocated military uprising against the Romans
- At Jewish weddings, the groom traditionally breaks a glass, reminding the celebrants that even in their hour of joy, they ought to recall Jerusalem destroyed.

- In 1909, Tel Aviv was born
- The agreement reached by Sykes and Picot, technically called the "Asia Minor Agreement" but commonly known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement, gave the French control over modern-day Syria and Lebanon. Britain, which needed unfetterd access to the Suez Canal was to get control of the coastal strip from the Mediterranean Sea to the river Jordan, an area of land that comprises modern-day Jordan, southern Iraq, the ports of Haifa and Acre and the entire Negev.
- A _kibbutz_ (plural kibbutzim) is the name for a collective community originally based largely on socialist ideals and rooted in agricultural work.
- _Yishuv_ means "area of settlement". It is also the term often used for the prestate Jewish community in Palestine. The "New Yishuv" refers to those Jews who began arriving with the immigrants, the "Old Yishuv" refers to those Jews who were already living in Palestine when the new immigrants began to arrive.
- A _moshav_ (moshavot or moshavim in plural) is the term for a cooperative rural Israeli town, usually in an agricultural area.

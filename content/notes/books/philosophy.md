### How Will You Measure Your Life?

- Problem is that what we think matters most in our jobs often doesn't align with what will really make us happy.
- In your life, there are going to be constant demands for your time and attention. How are you going to decide which of those demands gets resources? The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the fastest reward.
- One of the best ways to probe whether you can trust the advice that a theory is offering you is to look for anomalies - something that the theory cannot explain.
- _two-factor theory_ or _motivation theory_ that turns incentive theory on its head. It acknowledges that you can pay people to want what you want - over and over again.
- satisfaction and dissatisfaction are separate, independent measures. This means, for example, that it's possible to love your job and hate it at the same time.
- On one side of the equation, there are the elements of work that, if not done right, will cause us to be dissatisfied. These are called _hygiene factors_. Hygiene factors are things like status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and supervisory practices.
- _Motivation_ factors - the factors that will truly, deeply satisfy us, the factors that will cause us to love our jobs. These include challenging work, recognition, responsibilty, and personal growth.
- The most important time for the children to hear the words, the research suggests, is the first year of life.
- Language dancing involves talking to the child about "what if," and "do you remember," and "wouldn't it be nice if" - questions that invite the child to think deeply about what is happening around him.
- Options for your strategy spring from two very different sources. The first source is anticipated opportunities - the opportunities that you can see and choose to pursue.
- When you put in place a plan focused on these anticipated opportunities, you are pursuing a _deliberate_ strategy.
- The second source of options is unanticipated - usually a cocktail of problems and opportunities.
- How to analyze a project?
  - As the project teams to compile a list of all the assumptions that have been made in those initial projections.
  - Then ask - Which of these assumptions need to prove true in order for us to realistically expect that these numbers will materialize?
  - The assumptions on this list should be rank-ordered by importance and uncertainty. At the top of the list should be the assumptions that are most important and least certain, while the bottom of the list should be those that are least important and most certain.
- When the winning strategy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be _patient_ for growth but _impatient_ for profit.
- Many products fail because companies develop them from the wrong perspective. Companies focus too much on what they want to sell their customers, rather than what those customers really need.
- When a company understands the jobs that arise in people's lives, and then develops products and the accompanying experiences required in the purchasing and using the product to do the job perfectly, it causes customers to instinctively "pull" the product into their lives whenever the job arises.
- The theory of capabilities gives companies the framework to determine when outsourcing makes sense, when it does not. There are two important considerations
  - First, you must take a _dynamic_ view of your suppliers' capabilities. Assume that they can and will change.
  - Second, and most critical of all: figure out what capabilities you will need to succeed in the future. These _must_ stay in-house - otherwise, you are handing over the future of your business.
- Experience launching a new venture. None of them knew how to adjust a strategy when the first one didn't work. None had had to figure out how to make a brand-new product profitable before growing it big.
- Culture is a way of working together toward common goals that have been followed so frequently and so successfully that people don't even think about trying to do things another way.
- How culture is created ?
  - It starts with defining a problem - one that recurs again and again. Next, they must ask a group to figure out how to solve that problem. If they fail, ask them to find a better way to solve it.
- Culture in any organization is formed through repetition. That way of doing things becomes the group's culture.

### The Pig that wants to be eaten

- Is anything so self-evident that it cannot be doubted? Is it not possible that our lives are not more than dreams, or that the world is just a figment of our imaginations?
- What if we could create animals that had no interest in their own survival, simply because they had as little awareness as a carrot? How could it be wrong to deprive them of an existence they never knew they had? Or what if the animal actually wanted to be eaten?
- The philosopher spoke unto the Lord, 'You command us to do what is good. But is it good because you command it, or do you command it because it is good?
- Epiphenomenalism is the view that thoughts and other mental events do not cause anything in the physical world, including our actions. Rather, the brain and the body work like some kind of purely physical machine, and our conscious experience is a by-product, caused by the machine but not affecting it.

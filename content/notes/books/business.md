### Give and Take

- Successful givers have unique approaches to interactions in four key domains: networking, collaborating, evaluating, and influencing.
- Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse skills, and power. By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to knowledge, expertise, and influence.
- Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-being, or saying nice things about you behind your back. (opposite of paranoia)
- Research shows that givers get extra credit when they offer ideas that challenge the status quo.
- **Responsibility bias:** exaggerating our own contributions relative to others’ inputs.
- **Psychological safety:** the belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished.
- **Perspective gap:** when we’re not experiencing a psychologically or physically intense state, we dramatically underestimate how much it will affect us.
- **Grit:** having passion and perseverance toward long-term goals.
- If you want to engage your audience, if you really want to grab their attention, you have to know the world they live in, the music they listen to, the movies they watch.
- **Sunk cost fallacy:** when estimating the value of a future investment, we have trouble ignoring what we’ve already invested in the past.
- **Anticipated regret:** will I be sorry that I didn’t give this another chance?
- **Ego threat:** if I don’t keep investing, I’ll look and feel like a fool.
- Givers are more receptive to expertise from others, even if it challenges their own beliefs.
- There are two fundamental paths to influence: dominance and prestige. When we establish dominance, we gain influence because others see us as strong, powerful, and authoritative. When we earn prestige, we become influential because others respect and admire us.
- Asking questions is a form of powerless communication that givers adopt naturally. Questions work especially well when the audience is already sceptical of your influence.
- Advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority.
- He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.
- When presenting, givers make it clear that they’re expressing vulnerability not only to earn prestige but also to make a genuine connection with the audience.
- When selling, givers ask questions in a way that conveys the desire to help customers, not take advantage of them.
- When persuading and negotiating, givers speak tentatively and seek advice because they truly value the ideas and viewpoints of others.
- If people start volunteering two hours a week, their happiness, satisfaction, and self-esteem go up a year later.
- Chunking giving so that it’s energizing, is what makes otherish givers less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers.

### The Outsiders

- CEOs have five essential choices for deploying capital:
  - Investing in existing operations.
  - Acquiring other businesses.
  - Issuing dividends.
  - Paying down debt.
  - Repurchasing stock.
- And three alternatives for raising it:
  - Tapping internal cash flow.
  - Issuing debt.
  - Raising equity.
- Each (CEOs) ran a highly decentralized organization; made at least one very large acquisition; developed unusual, cash-flow based metrics; and bought back a significant amount of stock.
- When their stock was cheap, they bought it (often in large quantities), and when it was expensive, they used it to buy other companies or to raise inexpensive capital to fund future growth.
- Focus on industries with attractive economic characteristics, selectively use leverage to buy occassional large properties, improve operations, pay down debt, and repeat.
- There are two basic types of resources that any CEO needs to allocate: **financial** and **human**.
- Fundamentally, there are two basic approaches to buying back stock. In the most common contemporary approach, a company authorizes an amount of capital (usually a relatively small percentage of the excess cash on its balance sheet) for the repurchase of shares and then gradually over a period of quarters (sometimes years) buys in stock on the open market. This approach is careful, conservative, and, not coincidentally, unlikely to have any meaningful impact on long-term share values.
- Other approach by Singleton features less frequent and much larger repurchases timed to coincide with low stock prices - typically made within very short periods of time, often via tender offers, and occassionally funded with debt.
- So what do you do with a high priced stock? Use it to acquire a premium asset in a related field at a lower multiple and benefit from the arbitrage.
- Larger cable operators are able to negotiate lower programming costs per subscriber, and the more subscribers a cable company has, the lower its programming costs (and the higher its cash flow) per subscriber. These discounts continue to grow with size, providing powerful scale advantages for the largest players.
- Avoid cross-collaterization so that if one system defaulted on its debt, it would not affect the credit of the entire company.
- In a spin-off, a business unit is transferred from the parent company into a new corporate entity. Shareholders in the parent company are given equivalent pro rata ownership in the new company and can make their own decisions about whether to hold or sell these shares. Importantly, spin-offs highlight the value of smaller business units, allow for better alignment of management incentives, and, critically, defer capital gains taxes.
- Stock deals help avoid capital gains taxes.
- Decentralization, working to reduce layers of corporate bureaucracy and giving responsibility and autonomy for the company's key businesses a close-knit group of managers.
- During repurchases, prefer open-market purchases to larger tenders that might raise the stock price prematurely.
- Long term - term IRR on buybacks?
- _Float_, insurance premium income generated in advance of losses and expenses.
- Companies with low capital needs and the ability to raise prices.
- Capital allocation parable: The value of being in businesses with attractive returns on capital, and the related importance of getting out of low-return businesses.
- Deciding which businesses are no longer deserving of future investment due to low returns.
- Buffett believes that exceptional returns come from concentrated portfolios, that excellent investment ideas are rare.
- When there is a crisis that obscures the value of a strong underlying business, time to buy.
- The second pattern is timing investments to coincide with significant management or strategy changes.
- Hire well, manage little.
- Directors must have personal stake in the company. The managers should feel like owners of company.
- Value of financial projections must be determined by the quality of assumptions.
- They disdained dividends, made disciplined (occassionally large) acquisitions, used leverage selectively, bought back a lot of stock, minimized taxes, ran decentralized organizations, and focused on cash flow over reported net income.
- Falling market is universally regarded as far less threatening when the amount of activity in it is moderate rather than great.

### Shoe Dog

- Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.
- Converting sales into cash if done fast - the company is doing good.
- You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.
- I'd tell them to hit pause, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. I'd tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling.
- Hard work is critical, a good team is essential, brains and determination are invaluable, but luck may decide the outcome.

### Hit Refresh

- Three leadership principles
  - The first is to bring clarity to those you work with.
  - Second, leaders generate energy, not only on their own teams but across the company.
  - Third, and finally, they find a way to deliver success, to make things happen. This means driving innovations that people love and are inspired to work on; finding balance between long-term success and short-term wins; and being boundary-less and globally minded in seeking solutions.
- Learning or improvement in one skill or mental function can positively influence another one. The effect is transfer learning.
- Innovation in IoT; ambient intelligence; mobile payment systems; virtual reality; silicon photonics; 3D printing; wearables; lightweight, low altitude satellites; drones; native advertising; driverless cars; robotics and industrial automation; adaptive, gamified education; nano-machines; genomics; or economical solar, wind, and tidal power.

### What I learned loosing a million dollars

- Success can be built upon repeated failures when the failures aren’t taken personally; likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the successes are taken personally
- If a market is hit with very bullish news and instead of going up the market goes down, get out if you’re long
- It is easy to equate losing money in the market with being wrong. In doing so, you take what had been a decision about money (external) and make it a matter of reputation and pride (internal).
- Loss is objective when it is the same for me, you and anyone else. The loss is subjective when it differs from one person to another; when it is entirely a personal experience
- When an individual adheres to a market position despite the mounting losses, he is a crowd.
- People make purchases for only one of two reasons: to _feel better_ (satisfying a want) or to _solve a problem_ (saisfying a need). Trying to do the former in the financial markets is dangerous.
- If you occassionally break the rules and still have an unbroken string of successes, you're likely to compound the problem because you assume that you are better than other people and above the rules. Your ego inflates and you refuse to recognize the reality of a loss when it comes.
- When dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have three choices: engineering, gambling or speculating.
- Without a plan, you fall into one of two categories: a bettor if your main concern is being right, or a gambler if your main concern is entertainment.
- Most people who think they are investing are speculating. And most people who think they are speculating are gambling.
- **Investing** is parting with capital in the expectation of safety of principal and an adequate return on the capital in the form of dividends, interest or rent.
- Investing is usually associated with relatively long time horizon.
- **Trading** is basically an activity in which someone (usually called a dealer) makes a market in a given financial instrument. Traders try to extract the bid-ask spread from a market.
- **Speculating** in its simplest form is buying for resale rather than for use or income as is the case for commodities or financial instruments, respectively.
- If a person approaches a business risk or a risk in the financial markets for excitement, then he is gambling — regardless of how much control he supposedly has over the outcome.
- Psychological fallacies
  1. tendency to overvalue wagers involving a low probability of a high gain and to undervalue wagers involving a relatively high probability of low gain.
  2. The second is a tendency to interpret the probability of successive independent events as additive rather than multiplicative
  3. The third is the belief that after a run of successes, a failure is mathematically inevitable, and vice versa
  4. Fourth is the perception that the psychological probability of the occurrence of an event exceeds the mathematical probability if the event is favorable and vice-versa
  5. Fifth is people’s tendency to overestimate the frequency of the occurrence of infrequent events and to underestimate that of comparatively frequent ones
  6. Sixth is people’s tendency to confuse the occurrence of “unusual” events with the occurrence of low-probability events
- The definition of risk is to expose to the chance or possibility of loss. Most people erroneously try to assign a numerical value to that chance, which simply confuses risk with probability.
- All you can actually determine is the amount of your exposure as opposed to the probability that the market will, or will not, go to a certain price. Therefore, all you can do is manage your exposure and losses, not predict profits.
- The Minsky model: 
  1. Displacement - some exogenous event (war, crop failure, etc.) shocks the macro-economic system. 
  2. Opportunities — the displacement creates profitable opportunities in some sectors of the economy and closes down other sectors. Investment and production focuses on the profitable sectors and a boom is underway.
  3. Credit expansion — an expansion of credit feeds the boom. 
  4. Euphoria — speculation for price increases couples with investment for production/sale.
- Another common pattern used to describe the crowd overtaking a market is: 
  1. Speculation
  2. Credit expansion
  3. Financial distress
  4. Crisis
  5. Panic and crash.
- If you have ever had a position on and intended to do one thing but actually did something else, then you were a member of the psychological crowd and made a crowd trade — whether you knew it or not
- We have all been told not to buy/sell a stock or make trade based on hope or fear: never hope that a position will go our way and never fear that a position won’t go our way
- decision-making process is as follows:
  1. Decide what type of participant you’re going to be
  2. Select a method of analysis
  3. Develop rules
  4. Establish controls
  5. Formulate a plan.
- You must develop parameters that will define opportunities and determine how and when you will act. How? By doing homework (i.e., research, testing, trial-and-error), and defining the parameters with rules. Your homework determines what parameters or conditions define an opportunity, and your rules are the “if . . . , then . . .” statements which implement your analysis. This means entry and exit points are derived after you have done your analysis
- Remember, we are trying to manage possible scenarios and losses, not predict the future and profits.
- A preoccupation with wanting to be right or wanting to be perceived as being right, explains people's tendency to focus on _why_ the market is doing what it is doing instead of _what_ it is doing.
- In the markets and in business don't concern yourself with being right. Instead, follow your plan and watch the money.
- You must have a means to "objectively perceive" the market while making decisions and to maintain that _objectivity_ once you're in the market. That's exactly what a plan does.
- Taking either success or failure personally means, by definition, that your ego has become involved and you are in jeopardy of incurring losses due to psychological factors.
- A person's self image "should not be dependent on _particular_ successes or failures, since these are not necessarily in a man's direct, volitional control and/or not in his exclusive control. If a person judges himself by criterion that entail factors outside his volitional control, the result, unavoidably, is a precarious self-esteem that is in chronic jeopardy.
- You either try to tell the other players what you've got in your hand (a lock-jaw player), or you try not to tell them what you've got (a loose player), or you try to get them to think you've got something you don't have (also a loose player), all depending on what your agenda is. The good poker player tries to alternate between being a lockjaw player and a loose player.
- The next step in decision-making is establishing controls; i.e., the exit criteria which will take you out of the market either at a profit or loss. They take the form of a price order, a time stop or a condition stop (i.e., if a certain thing happens or fails to happen then you are getting out of the market).
- You must pick the loss side first. Why? Otherwise, after you enter the market everything you look at and hear will be skewed in favor of your position
- Before you decide to get into the market you have to decide: where (price) or when (time) or why (new information) you will no longer want the position.
- How do you determine the downside, and how do you control the downside, and do you control or minimize it? With objective decision-making and a plan which has as its starting point the stop-loss parameters.
- But not having a predetermined stop-loss can, and ultimately will, cost you a lot of money.

### A Man for all Markets

- Of the scores of indicators we systematically analyzed, several correlated strongly with past performance. Among them were earnings yield (annual earnings divided by price), dividend yield, book value divided by price, momentum, short interest (the number of shares of a company currently sold short), earnings surprise (an earnings announcement that is significantly and unexpectedly different from the analysts’ consensus), purchases and sales by company officers, directors, and large shareholders, and the ratio of total company sales to the market price of the company. We studied each of these separately, then worked out how to combine them.
- Normally when the futures were trading far enough below the index itself, the arbitrageurs sold short a basket of stocks that closely tracked the index and bought an offsetting position in the cheaper index futures. When the price of the futures and that of the basket of underlying stocks converged, as they do later when the futures contracts settle, the arbitrageur closes out the hedge and captures the original spread as a profit.
- satisficer, so-called because he is satisfied with a result that is close to the best, factors in the costs of searching and decision making, as well as the risk of losing a near-optimal opportunity and perhaps never finding anything as good again.
- Our level of market neutrality, measured by what financial theorists call beta, has averaged 0.06. When beta is zero for a portfolio, its price movements have no correlation with those of the market, and it is called market-neutral. Portfolios with positive beta tend to move up and down with the market, more so for larger beta. The beta of the market itself is chosen to be 1.0. Negative beta portfolios tend to fluctuate oppositely to the market.
- The idea of the project was to study how the historical returns of securities were related to various characteristics, or indicators. Among the scores of fundamental and technical measures we considered were the ratio of earnings per share to price per share, known as the earnings yield, the liquidation or “book” value of the company compared with its market price, and the total market value of the company
- He ranked stocks by their gain or loss over the previous two weeks. The stocks that had gone up the most did worse as a group than the market in the next few weeks, and the stocks that were the most down did better.
- Factors are common tendencies shared by several, many, or all companies. The most important is called the market factor, which measures the tendency of each stock price to move up and down with the market. The daily returns on any stock can be expressed as a part that follows the market plus what’s left over, the so-called residual.
- Some, like participation in a specified industry group or sector (say, oil or finance) mainly affect subgroups of stocks. Other factors, such as the market itself, the levels of short-term and long-term interest rates, and inflation, affect nearly all stocks.
- Stocks before the end of the current year, realizing losses that reduce the year’s income taxes. This behavior contributes to the so-called January effect where selling pressure in December further depresses the stock prices of the year’s losers, followed by a rebound and excessive performance in January. The impact is greater for smaller companies.

### The Big Short

- CDS : It was an insurance policy, typically on a corporate bond, with semiannual premium payments and a fixed term. For instance, you might pay $200k a year to buy a ten-year CDS on $100 million in General Electric bonds. The most you could lose was $2 million: $200k a year for 10 years. The most you could make was $100 million, if GE defaulted on its debt any time in the next 10 years and bondholders recovered nothing.
- Time is a variable continuum. An afternoon can fly by or it can take 5 hours. Like you probably do, I productively fill the gaps that most people leave as dead time. There are some select people that just find a drive in certain activities that supersedes EVERYTHING else.
- Poring over publicly available information and data on 10-K Wizard. He went looking for court rulings, deal completions, or government regulatory changes -- anything that might change the value of a company.
- I was looking for something happening in the courts that might lead to an investment thesis. An argument being accpeted, a plea being accepted, a settlement being accepted by the court.
- Investing well was all about being paid the right price for risk
- Large opportunities on which one can put nearly unlimited capital to work at tremendous potential returns are even more rare.
- Markets were predisposed to underestimating the likelihood of dramatic change.
- When the value of a stock so obviously turned on some upcoming event whose data was known (for a merger date, for instance, or a court data), the value investor could in good conscience employ options to express his views.
- Black-Scholes option pricing model, made some strange assumptions. For instance, it assumed a normal, bell-shaped distributions for future stock prices. If Capital One was trading at $30 a share, the model assumed that, over the next two years, the stock was more like to get to $35 a share than to $40, and more likely to get to $40 a share than to $45, and so on. This assumption made sense only to those who knew nothing about the company. In this case the model was totally missing the point: When Capital One stock moved, as it surely would, it was more likely to move by a lot than by a little.
- Start with what appeared to be a cheap option to buy or sell some Korean stock, or pork belly, or third-world currency -- really anything with a prices that seemed poised for some dramatic change -- and then work backward to the thing the option allowed you to buy or sell.
- We spent a lot of time building Black-Scholes models ourselves, and seeing what happened when you change various assumptions in them.
- People, and markets tended to underestimate the probability of extreme change.
- The rule of thumb is that you buy at ten and sell at twenty of gross rental.
- Financial options were systematically mispriced. The market often underestimated the likelihood of extreme moves in prices. The options market also tended to presuppose that the distant future would look more like the present than it usually did. Finally, the price of an option was a function of the volatility of the underlying stock or currency or commodity, and the options market tended to rely on the recent past to determine how volatile a stock or currency or commodity might be. When IBM stock was trading at $34 a share and had been hopping around madly for the past year, an option to buy it for $35 a share anytime soon was seldom underpriced. When gold had been trading around $650 an ounce for the past two years, an option to buy it for $2000 an ounce anytime during the next ten years might well be badly underpriced. The longer-term the option, the sillier the results generated by the BSM option pricing model, and the greater the opportunity for people who didn't use it.
- They were consciously looking for long shots. They were combing the markets for bets whose true odds were 10:1, priced as if the odds were 100:1. We were looking to get ourselves into a position where small changes in states of the world created huge changes in values.
- $500k a year in premium for the chance to make $100m. The market, and the rating agencies, effectively had set the odds of default at 1 in 200. ($100m/$500k). They thought the odds were better than that - say 1 in 10.
- When banking stops, credit stops, and when credit stops, trade stops. The entire modern world was premised on the ability to buy now and pay later.
- Interest rate swaps : in which one party swaps a floating rate of interest for another party's fixed rate to interest.

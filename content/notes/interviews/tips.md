The goal of your bullet points is to:
Highlight the technical work which you have done.
Highlight any domains you have had exposure to (building UI, building SDKs, building web services, interacting with cloud providers, working with databases, etc.).
Highlight technical challenges you faced and overcame.
Highlight the impact of your work.

Developed a back end web service to handle user authentication utilizing JWT and interacting with existing user services to store sessions data in a Redis cache, leading to a 14% reduction in complaints about dropped sessions
Developed a React-Native based mobile application by collaborating with product design teams, interacting with a GraphQL API allowing users to navigate and make orders to local restaurants. Led to better user engagement according to analytics funnels
Led the development of a data pipelines platform utilizing Kafka streams, ingesting data from various data stores from across the application. Resulted in a more streamlined developer experience for data query teams and reducing congestion by 24% during peak hours

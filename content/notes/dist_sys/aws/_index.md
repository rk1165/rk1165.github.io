![Storage Classes](/images/storage_classes.png)
  1. **S3 Standard** : Use S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data. It delivers low latency and high throughput.
  2. **S3 Standard IA** : Use S3 Standard Infrequent-Access for long-lived but less frequently accessed data that requires rapid access when needed. It offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per-GB storage price and per-GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance make S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage and backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.
  3. **S3 Intelligent Tiering** : Use S3 Intelligent Tiering storage class for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It delivers automatic cost savings by moving objects between four access tiers when access patterns change.
  4. **S3 One Zone-IA** : Use the S3 1Zone-IA storage class for long-lived data that requires rapid access when needed. S3 1Z-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. It is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data or data that can be re-created.
  5. **S3 Glacier** : Use the S3 Glacier storage classes for long-term archive and digital preservation at a drastically reduced cost.

![Direct Connect virtual interfaces](/images/direct_connect.png)

- A public virtual interface (VIF) gives you access to all Amazon public IP addresses for the associated AWS Region. Even though you are accessing public endpoints for services such as Amazon S3, public VIF traffic remains in the AWS Cloud. This has the impact of reducing security threats from internet communication and creating cost savings when downloading data from services like Amazon S3.
- When exchanging public IP prefixes over the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session, use public IPs for the session and as the announcement from the customer side of the connection.
- Use public IP addresses that you already own. If you don’t have any or they don’t fit well with your network architecture, open a case with AWS Support. You will be assigned a /31 CIDR that can be used.
- If you want to use a public Autonomous System Number (ASN), it must be owned by you. Otherwise, a private ASN is fine. AWS Direct Connect locations can access the public resources in any AWS Region using a public VIF.
